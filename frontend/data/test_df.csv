The different mechanisms leading to a solitary kidney should be differentiated because the long-term outcome might be different. The fetal period is the best moment to make a true diagnosis of congenital unilateral renal agenesis (URA). The objective was to determine the prevalence of URA at birth. The secondary objectives were to describe the evolution of sensitivity of prenatal diagnosis over time and the different forms of URA (isolated and associated with other malformations) detected up to 1 year.,28722320,"Congenital unilateral renal agenesis: Prevalence, prenatal diagnosis, associated anomalies.

It has been 10 years since we carried out a systematic search of the literature on birth defect risk in infants born following assisted reproductive technology (ART) compared with non-ART infants. Because of changes to ART practice since that review and the publication of more studies the objective of this review was to include these more recent studies to estimate birth defect risk after ART and to examine birth defect risk separately in ART singletons and multiples.,23449641,Assisted reproductive technology and birth defects: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,1,0

"Drug adverse events (AEs) are a major health threat to patients seeking medical treatment and a significant barrier in drug discovery and development. AEs are now required to be submitted during clinical trials and can be extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov ( https://clinicaltrials.gov/ ), a database of clinical studies around the world. By extracting drug and AE information from ClinicalTrials.gov and structuring it into a database, drug-AEs could be established for future drug development and repositioning. To our knowledge, current AE databases contain mainly U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs. However, our database contains both FDA-approved and experimental compounds extracted from ClinicalTrials.gov . Our database contains 8,161 clinical trials of 3,102,675 patients and 713,103 reported AEs. We extracted the information from ClinicalTrials.gov using a set of python scripts, and then used regular expressions and a drug dictionary to process and structure relevant information into a relational database. We performed data mining and pattern analysis of drug-AEs in our database. Our database can serve as a tool to assist researchers to discover drug-AE relationships for developing, repositioning, and repurposing drugs.",27631620,Big Data Mining and Adverse Event Pattern Analysis in Clinical Drug Trials.,0,1

"Among patients treated with the anticonvulsive and psychotropic drug carbamazepine (CBZ), approximately 10% develop severe and life-threatening adverse drug reactions. These immunological conditions are resolved upon withdrawal of the medicament, suggesting that the drug does not manifest in the body in long term. The HLA allele B∗15:02 has been described to be a genomic biomarker for CBZ-mediated immune reactions. It is not well understood if the immune reactions are triggered by the original drug or by its metabolite carbamazepine-10,11-epoxide (EPX) and how the interaction between the drug and the distinct HLA molecule occurs. Genetically engineered human B-lymphoblastoid cells expressing soluble HLA-B∗15:02 molecules were treated with the drug or its metabolite. Functional pHLA complexes were purified; peptides were eluted and sequenced. Applying mass spectrometric analysis, CBZ and EPX were monitored by analyzing the heavy chain and peptide fractions separately for the presence of the drug. This method enabled the detection of the drug in a biological situation post-pHLA assembly. Both drugs were bound to the HLA-B∗15:02 heavy chain; however, solely EPX altered the peptide-binding motif of B∗15:02-restricted peptides. This observation could be explained through structural insight; EPX binds to the peptide-binding region and alters the biochemical features of the F pocket and thus the peptide motif. Understanding the nature of immunogenic interactions between CBZ and EPX with the HLA immune complex will guide towards effective and safe medications.",30302345,"Carbamazepine-Mediated Adverse Drug Reactions: CBZ-10,11-epoxide but Not Carbamazepine Induces the Alteration of Peptides Presented by HLA-B∗15:02.",0,1

"Therapeutics may induce embryological abnormalities in the laboratory animal, Now, it is known from experience that the currently applied experimental procedures allow to detect potential teratogenic risks in animals. There is only a slight possibility that a new therapeutic would be highly teratogenic as very special conditions are fundamental for the exteriorisation of the teratogenic effect, such as the sensibility and the developmental stage of the embryo, its genetic constitution and the physiology and pathology of the mother. The wellknown difficulties associated with the extrapolation of experimental results require that more species are used and that historical control data for each species and strains are kept allowing a global assessment of the results which better weighs the potential risk against the therapeutic activity of each new therapeutic.",7258038,[Estimation of the teratogenic effects of therapeutic drugs].,1,1

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the leading causes of hospital admissions and morbidity in developed countries and represent a substantial burden on healthcare delivery systems. However, there is little data available from low- and middle-income countries. This review compares the prevalence and characteristics of ADR-related hospitalisations in adults in developed and developing countries, including the mortality, severity and preventability associated with these events, commonly implicated drugs and contributing factors. A literature search was conducted via PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, ProQuest and Google Scholar to find articles published in English from 2000 to 2015. Relevant observational studies were included. The median (with interquartile range [IQR]) prevalence of ADR-related hospitalisation in developed and developing countries was 6.3 % (3.3-11.0) and 5.5 % (1.1-16.9), respectively. The median proportions of preventable ADRs in developed and developing countries were 71.7 % (62.3-80.0) and 59.6 % (51.5-79.6), respectively. Similarly, the median proportions of ADRs resulting in mortality in developed and developing countries were 1.7 % (0.7-4.8) and 1.8 % (0.8-8.0), respectively. Commonly implicated drugs in both settings were antithrombotic, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and cardiovascular drugs. Older age, female gender, number of medications, renal impairment and heart failure were reported to be associated with an increased risk for ADR-related hospitalisation in both settings while HIV/AIDS was implicated in developing countries only. The majority of ADRs were preventable in both settings, highlighting the importance of improving medication use, particularly in vulnerable patient groups such as the elderly, patients with multiple comorbidities and, in developing countries, patients with HIV/AIDS.",27449638,Adverse-Drug-Reaction-Related Hospitalisations in Developed and Developing Countries: A Review of Prevalence and Contributing Factors.,0,0

"<b>BACKGROUND:</b> A fundamental responsibility of aerospace medicine is the analysis and mitigation of the human component's risk to the aviation system. Medications are part of this risk mitigation process and are present within a multitude of work environments, including aviation. For example, during fiscal year (FY) 2013-2015, the Army Aeromedical Activity (AAMA) received 8596 medication waiver requests. During this same time period the U.S. Army Medical Department's Patient Administration Systems and Biostatistics Activity reported the organization prescribed over 187,668 prescriptions for opioids, 133,475 prescriptions for SSRIs, 116,649 prescriptions for muscle relaxants, and 71,723 prescriptions for hypnotics to its active duty soldiers in the outpatient setting.<b>METHODS:</b> A conceptual model to mitigate the risk of adverse reactions to medications by severity score was developed based off the methodology published by Prudhomme et al.<b>RESULTS:</b> The mean severity score of the 50 historically safe medications in the Army aviation community is 7346. The standard deviation of the population is 7300. The difference between safe and unsafe drugs determined by subject matter experts (SME) is highly significant when tested with the nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test.<b>CONCLUSION:</b> The visual representation of the data from this conceptual model clearly demonstrates room for improvement from current methods. Historically, utilizing SME opinion has created a system with deficiencies related to high variance, inconsistencies, and perceived ambiguity. There is need for a model addressing adverse drug reactions that has concrete strengths of transparency, simplicity, and speed of use.<b>Cronrath CM, Klick MP, Merfeld CM, Gaydos SJ. <i>Medication Adverse Reaction, Risk Stratification (MAR</i></b><sup>

"Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) play an important role in susceptibility to complex diseases, treatment efficacy and adverse drug responses. Conventional methods to detect SNPs are usually based on PCR or DNA sequencing, which are typically time-consuming and require sophisticated equipment. In this proof-of-concept study, a probe-directed recombinase amplification (PDRA) assay was developed to detect the A1298C polymorphism of 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR). The PDRA assay included two real-time reactions to detect the A and C nucleotides of A1298C polymorphism. Each reaction contained only one primer and one probe and was finished at 39°C within 35 min. The results of genotyping of 150 clinical samples using PDRA were completely consistent with those by direct sequencing. Additionally, when the 1000 Genomes Project HCB frequencies were used as the control group, MTHFR A1298C was found to be associated with congenital heart disease. In conclusion, the proposed novel PDRA assay is a valuable tool for the detection of SNPs and demonstrates significant potential to be widely applicable in both research and clinical settings.",29793361,A probe directed recombinase amplification assay for detection of MTHFR A1298C polymorphism associated with congenital heart disease.,1,1

"Fetal malformations complicate approximately 3% of all pregnancies. Many of these are minor or can be corrected after birth, but there are certain malformations that are lethal and others that are severe and others, that, even if corrected lead to permanent disability. Advances in prenatal diagnosis made possible the diagnosis of many fetal malformations. This led to the concept of the fetus a patient, independent of the pregnant woman, even though the moral status of the fetus is in dispute. Many of the lethal malformations are untreatable. However, for some, innovative in utero treatments, both medical and surgical, became possible. These interventions should be evaluated for the relative benefit and risk for both the fetus and the mother, because any such treatment has to involve the integrity of her body. This raises the ethical question of beneficence (to the fetus) versus the autonomy of the pregnant woman. The process of resolving this issue will be discussed, especially how to obtain a truly informed consent. For the lethal malformations or for those severe or multiple malformations whose treatment is theoretically possible but the results of such treatment are unpredictable or may lead to life long disabilities and serious burdens for the infant or child and the family, prenatal counseling should include ""prenatal advance directive"" and a plan for palliative care, the components of which will be described.",23610506,Ethical aspects of prenatal diagnosis of fetal malformations.,0,0
"Autosomal-recessive SLOS is caused by mutations in the DHCR7 gene. It is defined as a highly variable complex of microcephaly with intellectual disability, characteristic facies, hypospadias, and polysyndactyly. Syndrome diagnosis is often missed at prenatal ultrasound and fetal autopsy METHODS: We performed autopsies and DHCR7 gene analyses in eight fetuses suspected of having SLOS and measured cholesterol values in long-term formalin-fixed tissues of an additional museum exhibit RESULTS: Five of the nine fetuses presented classical features of SLOS, including four cases with atrial/atrioventricular septal defects and renal anomalies, and one with additional bilateral renal agenesis and a Dandy-Walker cyst. These cases allowed for diagnosis at autopsy and subsequent SLOS diagnosis in two siblings. Two fetuses were mildly affected and two fetuses showed additional holoprosencephaly. These four cases and the exhibit had escaped diagnosis at autopsy. The case with bilateral renal agenesis presented a novel combination of a null allele and a putative C-terminus missense mutation in the DHCR7 gene CONCLUSIONS: In view of the discrepancy between the prevalence of SLOS among newborns and the carrier frequency of a heterozygous DHCR7 gene mutation, the syndrome-specific internal malformation pattern may be helpful not to miss SLOS diagnosis in fetuses at prenatal ultrasound and fetal autopsy.",31840946,Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome - Fetal phenotypes with special reference to the syndrome-specific internal malformation pattern.,0,0

"Trichloroethylene (TCE), a widely used organic solvent, is a common environmental pollutant. Increasing evidence indicates that maternal TCE exposure is associated with congenital cardiac defects, but the underlining mechanisms remain largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that TCE exposure significantly induced heart defects and dysfunctions in zebrafish embryos. Heart tissues were dissected and subjected to high throughput sequencing and qPCR to identify differentially expressed miRNAs and mRNAs. The effects of miRNA were further verified by microinjection of antagomir or agomir. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) and cell proliferation were measured by using dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (DCFH-DA) and EdU staining, respectively. Our results showed that 19 miRNAs were downregulated whereas 48 miRNAs were upregulated in the heart of zebrafish embryos. The downregulation of miR-133a and the upregulation of miR-182 were further validated. Moreover, we found that miR-133a agomir significantly alleviated the TCE-induced heart defects while miR-133a antagomir mimicked the toxic effect of TCE on heart development. Furthermore, miR-133a agomir significantly counteracted TCE-induced ROS production and excessive cell proliferation in the heart of zebrafish embryos.

We systematically screened new indications for 1234 drugs with more than 2 network neighbours, 36.87% of the drugs achieved a performance score of Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain in the top 5 positions (NDCG@5) ≥ 0.7, which means most of the known FDA-approved indications were well predicted at the top 5 positions.

Additionally, by manually checking the predicted 1858 drug-indication pairs with Expression Analysis Systematic Explorer (EASE) score ≤ 10(-5) (EASE score is a rigorously modified Fisher exact test p value), we found that 80.73% of such pairs could be verified by preclinical/clinical studies or scientific literature. Furthermore, our method could be extended to predict drugs not covered in the network. We took 98 external drugs not covered in the network as the test sample set. Based on our similarity criteria using side effects, we identified 41 drugs with significant similarities to other drugs in the network. Among them, 36.59% of the drugs achieved NDCG@5 ≥ 0.7. In all of the 106 drug-indication pairs with an EASE score ≤ 0.05, 50.94% of them are supported by FDA approval or preclinical/clinical studies. In summary, our method which is based on the indications enriched by network neighbors may provide new clues for drug repositioning using side effects.",24505324,Construction of drug network based on side effects and its application for drug repositioning.,0,1
"Prolongation of the QT interval and the cardiac action potential have been linked to a potentially fatal but rare tachyarrhythmia known as Torsades de Pointes (TdP). Nonclinical assays, such as those investigating the effect on I(Kr) (the hERG channel current), prolongation of the action potential duration (APD) and the QT interval, in vivo, have been developed to predict the risk of QT interval prolongation and TdP in man. However, there seems to be a dissociation between the risk of QT interval prolongation and the torsadogenic risk. There is an increasing mass of evidence showing that an increase in the QT interval does not necessarily lead to TdP. Thus, it appears that while standard assays are very good, although perhaps not infallible, at predicting the risk of QT interval prolongation in man they do not predict the proarrhythmic risk. Recently there has been a plethora of publications suggesting that there are electrophysiological markers associated with drug-induced TdP other than hERG channel activity, APD and the QT interval, and these markers may be better predictors of TdP. In this review, three in vitro and, briefly, three in vivo models or methods are discussed. These proarrhythmia models use electrophysiological markers such as transmural dispersion of repolarization, action potential triangulation, instability, reverse use-dependence, and the incidence of early after-depolarizations to predict the risk of TdP. Most of the models presented have been published widely. The particular variable or set of variables used by each model to predict the torsadogenic propensity of a drug has been reported to correlate with clinical outcome. While each variable/model has been shown to discriminate between antiarrhythmic and nonarrhythmic drugs, these reports should be interpreted cautiously since none has been independently (externally) assessed. Each model is discussed along with its particular merits and shortcomings; none, as yet, having shown a predictive value that makes it clearly superior to the others. Proarrhythmia models, in particular in vitro models, challenge current perceptions of appropriate surrogates for TdP in man and question existing nonclinical strategies for assessing proarrhythmic risk. The rapid emergence of such models, compounded by the lack of a clear understanding of the key proarrhythmic mechanisms has resulted in a regulatory reluctance to embrace such models. The wider acceptance of proarrhythmia models is likely to occur when there is a clear understanding and agreement on the key proarrhythmia mechanisms. Regardless of regulatory acceptance, with further validation these models may still enhance pharmaceutical company decision-making to provide a rational basis for drug progression, particularly in areas of unmet medical need.",15975832,Nonclinical proarrhythmia models: predicting Torsades de Pointes.,1,1
"Neonatal micropenis and cryptorchidism raise the suspicion of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (CHH), a rare genetic disorder caused by gonadotropin-releasing hormone deficiency. Low plasma testosterone levels and low gonadotropins during minipuberty provide a clinical diagnostic clue, yet these tests are seldomly performed in general practice. We report a male neonate with no family history of reproductive disorders who was born with micropenis and cryptorchidism. Hormonal testing at age 2.5 months showed low testosterone (0.3 nmol/L) and undetectable gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone both <0.5 U/L), suggestive of CHH. Genetic testing identified a de novo, heterozygous mutation in fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1 p.L630P). L630 resides on the ATP binding cleft of the FGFR1 tyrosine kinase domain, and L630P is predicted to cause a complete loss of receptor function. Cell-based assays confirmed that L630P abolishes FGF8 signaling activity. Identification of a loss-of-function de novo FGFR1 mutation in this patient confirms the diagnosis of CHH, allowing for a timely hormonal treatment to induce pubertal development. Therefore, genetic testing can complement clinical and hormonal assessment for a timely diagnosis of CHH in childhood.",28195315,Genetic testing facilitates prepubertal diagnosis of congenital hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.,1,0
"Epidemiological research designed to explore causality of illness has produced increasing evidence to verify that exposure to toxic agents is contributing to the escalating burden of chronic affliction, including congenital disorders. While endeavoring to facilitate optimal health and well-being for patients, the medical profession is currently challenged by the consequences of environmental factors unique to the modern era. In the last half century, there have been profound shifts in health-related habits of individuals and population groups, and recent research suggests that changes in the home and workplace environment are responsible for many common health problems including various congenital anomalies. As a result of increasing concern about environmental influences on health, 'Human Exposure Assessment,' the investigation and study of specific patient exposures and related health concerns, is a rapidly expanding area of scientific research.

"<b>Background:</b> The addition of bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy improves the pathological complete response rate of human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer patients. However, the characteristics of adverse events associated with the use of bevacizumab should receive more attention from clinicians. <b>Objective:</b> This meta-analysis aimed to detect the adverse events of adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy compared with neoadjuvant chemotherapy alone in HER2-negative breast cancer patients. <b>Methods:</b> PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases were systematically accessed to find eligible studies from January 1, 2000, to October 20, 2019. Reference lists were searched for additional studies. Pooled risk ratios for adverse events of bevacizumab were meta-analyzed. <b>Results:</b> Overall, 6 of 829 initially identified studies met the inclusion criteria, with 4681 patients randomized (2321 in the bevacizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy group and 2360 in the neoadjuvant chemotherapy group). The incidence of grade ≥3 hypertension, left-ventricular dysfunction, mucositis, febrile neutropenia, infection, pain, hand-foot syndrome, hemorrhage, and neutropenia significantly increased in patients treated with bevacizumab plus neoadjuvant chemotherapy. However, adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not associated with increasing the incidences of grade ≥3 proteinuria, dyspnea, heart failure, peripheral neurotoxicity, thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, fatigue, leucopenia, vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. <b>Conclusion and Relevance:</b> Adding bevacizumab to neoadjuvant chemotherapy to treat HER2-negative breast cancer patients increased adverse events. However, most adverse events are clinically manageable. Patients, therefore, need to be monitored carefully for hypertension, left-ventricular dysfunction, mucositis, febrile neutropenia, infection, pain, hand-foot syndrome, hemorrhage, and neutropenia when treated with bevacizumab and neoadjuvant chemotherapy simultaneously.",31855061,Comparative Toxicities of Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy With or Without Bevacizumab in HER2-Negative Breast Cancer Patients: A Meta-analysis.,0,1
"Congenital cytomegalovirus is the most frequent, yet under-recognised, infectious cause of newborn malformation in developed countries. Despite its clinical and public health importance, questions remain regarding the best diagnostic methods for identifying maternal and neonatal infection, and regarding optimal prevention and therapeutic strategies for infected mothers and neonates. The absence of guidelines impairs global efforts to decrease the effect of congenital cytomegalovirus. Data in the literature suggest that congenital cytomegalovirus infection remains a research priority, but data are yet to be translated into clinical practice. An informal International Congenital Cytomegalovirus Recommendations Group was convened in 2015 to address these questions and to provide recommendations for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment. On the basis of consensus discussions and a review of the literature, we do not support universal screening of mothers and the routine use of cytomegalovirus immunoglobulin for prophylaxis or treatment of infected mothers. However, treatment guidelines for infected neonates were recommended. Consideration must be given to universal neonatal screening for cytomegalovirus to facilitate early detection and intervention for sensorineural hearing loss and developmental delay, where appropriate. The group agreed that education and prevention strategies for mothers were beneficial, and that recommendations will need continual updating as further data become available.",28291720,"Congenital cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy and the neonate: consensus recommendations for prevention, diagnosis, and therapy.",1,0

"Recent withdrawals of prescription drugs from clinical use because of unexpected side effects on the heart have highlighted the need for more reliable cardiac safety pharmacology assays. Block of the human Ether-a-go go Related Gene (hERG) ion channel in particular is associated with life-threatening arrhythmias, such as Torsade de Pointes (TdP). Here we investigated human cardiomyocytes derived from pluripotent (embryonic) stem cells (hESC) as a renewable, scalable, and reproducible system on which to base cardiac safety pharmacology assays. Analyses of extracellular field potentials in hESC-derived cardiomyocytes (hESC-CM) and generation of derivative field potential duration (FPD) values showed dose-dependent responses for 12 cardiac and noncardiac drugs. Serum levels in patients of drugs with known effects on QT interval overlapped with prolonged FPD values derived from hESC-CM, as predicted. We thus propose hESC-CM FPD prolongation as a safety criterion for preclinical evaluation of new drugs in development. This is the first study in which dose responses of such a wide range of compounds on hESC-CM have been generated and shown to be predictive of clinical effects. We propose that assays based on hESC-CM could complement or potentially replace some of the preclinical cardiac toxicity screening tests currently used for lead optimization and further development of new drugs.",20034863,Prediction of drug-induced cardiotoxicity using human embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.,1,1

"Background The majority of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reported in the summary of product characteristics (SPCs) are based on pivotal clinical trials, performed under controlled conditions and with selected patients. Objectives (1) to observe ADRs in the real-world setting and to evaluate if the supervision of the pharmacist impacts on the management of ADRs and on the satisfaction of patients; (2) to sensitise health professionals and patients on the need to increase the reporting of ADRs, in compliance with Pharmacovigilance. Setting CRO Aviano, Italian National Cancer Institute. Method From February 2013 to April 2015, we conducted an observational study enrolling 154 patients (≥ 18 years) undergoing treatment with at least one of ten targeted-therapies included in the study. Main outcome ADR reporting in the real-world setting. Patient satisfaction with clinical pharmacist support. Results Reported ADRs in the real setting do not always correspond with data described in the respective SPCs. Unknown ADRs were also identified such as hyperglycaemia with lenalidomide and sorafenib; and hypomagnesaemia with bevacizumab. We also observed a 124.3% increase in spontaneous reports.

"We previously reviewed the cardiovascular safety of 16 tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), approved for use in oncology as of 30 September 2012. Since then, the indications for some of them have been widened and an additional nine TKIs have also been approved as of 30 April 2015. Eight of these nine are indicated for use in oncology and one (nintedanib) for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. This report is an update on the cardiovascular safety of those 16 TKIs, including the post-marketing data concerning their pro-arrhythmic effects, and reviews the cardiovascular safety of the nine new TKIs approved since (afatinib, cabozantinib, ceritinib, dabrafenib, ibrutinib, lenvatinib, nintedanib, ponatinib, and trametinib). As before, we focus on specific aspects of cardiovascular safety, namely their potential to induce QT interval prolongation, left ventricular (LV) dysfunction and hypertension but now also summarise the risks of arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) associated with these agents. Of the newer TKIs, cabozantinib and ceritinib have been shown to induce a mild to moderate degree of QTc interval prolongation while cardiac dysfunction has been reported with the use of afatinib, dabrafenib, lenvatinib, ponatinib and trametinib. The label for axitinib was revised to include a new association with cardiac dysfunction. Hypertension is associated with cabozantinib, lenvatinib, nintedanib, ponatinib and trametinib. Ponatinib, within 10 months of its approval in December 2012, required voluntary (temporary) suspension of its marketing until significant safety revisions (restricted indication, additional warnings and precautions about the risk of arterial occlusion and thromboembolic events and amended dose) were made to its label. Compared with the previous 16 TKIs, more of the recently introduced TKIs are associated with the risk of LV dysfunction, and fewer with QT prolongation. Available data on morbidity and mortality associated with TKIs, together with post-marketing experience with lapatinib and ponatinib, emphasise the need for effective pharmacovigilance and ongoing re-assessment of their risk/benefit after approval of these novel agents. If not adequately managed, these cardiovascular effects significantly decrease the quality of life and increase the morbidity and mortality in a population already at high risk. Evidence accumulated over the last decade suggests that their clinical benefit, although worthwhile, is modest and extends only to progression-free survival and complete response without any effect on overall survival. During uncontrolled use in routine clinical practice, their risk/benefit is likely to be inferior to that perceived from highly controlled clinical trials.",26008987,"Update on Cardiovascular Safety of Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors: With a Special Focus on QT Interval, Left Ventricular Dysfunction and Overall Risk/Benefit.",1,1

"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is an independent risk factor for brain injury, including stroke, and poor neurodevelopmental outcomes, and placental abnormalities may represent an additional risk factor for brain injury in neonates. The incidence and scope of placental pathology and relationship to fetal brain abnormalities in pregnancies complicated by fetal CHD has not been explored to our knowledge. In order to determine the prevalence of placental pathology findings and whether placental findings are associated with postnatal brain injury in pregnancies complicated by fetal CHD, we reviewed placental pathology reports for 51 pregnancies complicated by CHD and scored available postnatal, pre-operative brain MRI for brain pathology. Overall, 57% of CHD infants had abnormal placental pathology. Pregnancies complicated by CHD with aortic obstruction (AO) were significantly more likely than those with no obstruction to have abnormal placental pathology (79% vs. 44%). There was a trend toward more severe brain lesions amongst patients with brain lesions and placental abnormality (55% moderate/severe) compared to those without placental abnormality (11% moderate/severe). These data suggest that placental abnormalities are common in CHD and may have a compounding effect on brain lesions in this high-risk population.",30858514,Placental Pathology and Neuroimaging Correlates in Neonates with Congenital Heart Disease.,0,0
"Biomonitoring efforts have clearly shown that all humans are exposed to chemical mixtures. Of concern is whether or not exposure to mixtures during pregnancy contributes to congenital abnormalities in children even when each chemical is at an individual dose that does not affect the fetus. Here, we hypothesized that in utero exposure to a mixture of chemicals covering multiple ""antiandrogenic"" mechanisms of action at doses that individually have no adverse effect would result in permanent reproductive tract alterations in the male rat after birth. Pregnant dams were exposed to a range of dilutions (100%, 50%, 25%, 12.5%, 6.25%, or vehicle control) of a mixture containing pesticides, phthalates, and drugs (p, p'-DDE, linuron, prochloraz, procymidone, pyrifluquinazon, vinclozolin, finasteride, flutamide, simvastatin, and 9 phthalates [dipentyl, dicyclohexyl, di-2-ethylhexyl, dibutyl, benzyl butyl, diisobutyl, diisoheptyl, dihexyl, and diheptyl]). The top dose contained each chemical at 20% of its lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) for the most sensitive male reproductive alteration following in utero exposure. We found that male rat offspring displayed a variety of neonatal, pubertal, and permanent adult effects across all dose levels. Even at the lowest dose (each chemical approximately 80-fold below lowest observed adverse effect level) there were permanent reductions in several reproductive tract tissue weights. In the top dose group, 100% of male offspring displayed permanent severe birth defects including genital malformations. Despite acting via 5 different molecular initiating events, a mixture of 18 chemicals can combine to produce additive effects even when each compound is at is at a relatively low dose.",29945228,"Mixed ""Antiandrogenic"" Chemicals at Low Individual Doses Produce Reproductive Tract Malformations in the Male Rat.",1,1
"Long QT syndrome (LQTS) is a disorder of the heart's electrical activity that infrequently causes severe ventricular arrhythmias such as a type of ventricular tachycardia called torsade de pointes (TdP) and ventricular fibrillation, which can be fatal. There have been no previous reports on the time-to-onset for LQTS based on data from spontaneous reporting systems. The aim of this study was to assess the time-to-onset of LQTS according to drug treatment. We analyzed the association between 113 drugs in 37 therapeutic categories and LQTS including TdP using data obtained from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database. For signal detection, we used the reporting odds ratio (ROR). Furthermore, we analyzed the time-to-onset data and assessed the hazard type using the Weibull shape parameter. The RORs (95% confidence interval) for bepridil, amiodarone, pilsicainide, nilotinib, disopyramide, arsenic trioxide, clarithromycin, cibenzoline, donepezil, famotidine, sulpiride, and nifekalant were 174.4 (148.6-204.6), 17.3 (14.7-20.4), 52.0 (43.4-62.4), 13.9 (11.5-16.7), 69.3 (55.3-86.8), 54.2 (43.2-68.0), 4.7 (3.8-5.8), 19.9 (15.9-25.0), 8.1 (6.5-10.1), 3.2 (2.5-4.1), 7.1 (5.5-9.2), and 254.8 (168.5-385.4), respectively.

"To compare the proportion, seriousness, preventability of adverse drug events (ADEs) between the older adults (≥ 65 years old) and younger adults (<65 years old) presenting to the emergency department (ED), we conducted a prospective observational cohort study of patients 18 years and older presenting to the ED. For all ED visits between March 1, 2009, and Feb 28, 2010, investigators identified ADEs and assessed cases using the Naranjo adverse drug reaction probability scale. Outcomes (proportion, seriousness, and preventability of ADE, length of ED stay, and hospitalization) and associated variables were measured and compared between younger and older adults. The results showed that of 58,569 ED visits, 295 older adults, and 157 younger adults were diagnosed as having an ADE and included in our analysis. The proportion of ADEs leading to ED visits in the older group, 14.3 per 1000  (295/20,628), was significantly higher than the younger group of 4.1 per 1000  (157/37,941). The older group with ADE had a longer ED stay (odds ratio [OR] 3.5, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.9-6.4 for stay ≥ 24 hours) and larger proportion of preventable ADEs (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6) than the younger group, but there was no significant difference in terms of serious ADEs (OR 0.6, 95% CI 0.3-1.3 for fatal and life threatening) and hospitalization (OR 1.5, 95% CI 0.9-2.6) between the 2 groups. In addition, patients in the older group were more likely to be male, to have symptoms of fatigue or altered mental status, to involve cardiovascular, renal, and respiratory systems, and to have higher Charlson comorbidity index scores, higher number of prescription medications, and higher proportion of unintentional overdose. In conclusion, the proportion of ADE-related ED visits in older adults was higher than younger adults, and many of these were preventable. The most common drug categories associated with preventable ADEs in the older adults were antithrombotic agents, antidiabetic agents, and cardiovascular agents.",25700322,Comparing characteristics of adverse drug events between older and younger adults presenting to a Taiwan emergency department.,0,1
"Predicting novel drug side-effects, or Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), plays an important role in the drug discovery process. Existing methods consider mainly the chemical and biological characteristics of each drug individually, thereby neglecting information hidden in the relationships among drugs. Complementary to the existing individual methods, in this paper, we propose a novel network approach for ADR prediction that is called Augmented Random-WAlk with Restarts (ARWAR). ARWAR, first, applies an existing method to build a network of highly related drugs. Then, it augments the original drug network by adding new nodes and new edges to the network and finally, it applies Random Walks with Restarts to predict novel ADRs. Empirical results show that the ARWAR method presented here outperforms the existing network approach by 20% with respect to average Fmeasure. Furthermore, ARWAR is capable of generating novel hypotheses about drugs with respect to novel and biologically meaningful ADR.

"Evidence of an association between early pregnancy exposure to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and congenital heart defects (CHD) has contributed to recommendations to weigh benefits and risks carefully. The objective of this study was to determine the specificity of association between first trimester exposure to SSRIs and specific CHD and other congenital anomalies (CA) associated with SSRI exposure in the literature (signals). A population-based case-malformed control study was conducted in 12 EUROCAT CA registries covering 2.1 million births 1995-2009 including livebirths, fetal deaths from 20 weeks gestation and terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly. Babies/fetuses with specific CHD (n = 12,876) and non-CHD signal CA (n = 13,024), were compared with malformed controls whose diagnosed CA have not been associated with SSRI in the literature (n = 17,083).

"The toxicity of petroleum hydrocarbons to marine aquatic organisms has been widely investigated; however, the effects on freshwater environments have largely been ignored. In the Australian freshwater environment, the potential impacts of petroleum hydrocarbons are virtually unknown. The toxicity of crude oil and related compounds were measured in the sensitive early life stages of the crimson-spotted rainbowfish (Melanotaenia fluviatilis). Waterborne petroleum hydrocarbons crossed the chorion of embryonic rainbowfish, reducing survival and hatchability. Acute exposures resulted in developmental abnormalities at and above 0.5 mg/L total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH). Deformities included pericardial edema, disturbed axis formation, and abnormal jaw development. When assessing the acute toxicities of the water-accommodated fraction (WAF) of crude oil, dispersants, dispersant-oil mixtures, and naphthalene to larval rainbowfish, the lowest to highest 96-h median lethal concentrations for day of hatch larvae were naphthalene (0.51 mg/L), dispersed crude oil WAF (DCWAF)-9527 (0.74 mg/L TPH), WAF (1.28 mg/L TPH), DCWAF-9500 (1.37 mg/L TPH), Corexit 9500 (14.5 mg/L TPH), and Corexit 9527 (20.1 mg/L).

"Knowledge of the anatomy of the coronary sinus (CS) and cardiac venous drainage is important because of its relevance in electrophysiologic procedures and cardiac surgeries. Several procedures make use of the CS, such as left ventricular pacing, mapping and ablation of arrhythmias, retrograde cardioplegia, targeted drug delivery, and stem cell therapy. As a result, it is more important for physicians interpreting the results of computed tomographic (CT) examinations dedicated to the heart or including the heart to be able to identify normal variants and congenital anomalies and to understand their clinical importance. Abnormalities of the CS range from anatomic morphologic variations to hemodynamically significant anomalies such as an unroofed CS, anomalous pulmonary venous connection to the CS, and coronary artery-CS fistula. It can be important to identify some anatomic variations, even though they are clinically occult, to ensure appropriate preprocedural planning.

"Antenatally, congenital pulmonary airway malformation (CPAM) causing fetal hydrops can be palliated with thoracoamniotic shunts, which may become displaced in utero. We report a case of an infant born at 34 weeks gestational age with an antenatally diagnosed macrocystic lung lesion, fetal hydrops and an internally displaced thoracoamniotic shunt. The infant suffered refractory pneumothoraces despite multiple chest drains, and stabilised only after surgical resection of the lesion. Intraoperatively, the shunt was noted to form a connection between a type I CPAM and the pleural space. As the shunt was displaced internally, this complication was not immediately obvious during the initial resuscitation. In infants with large cystic lung lesions, clinicians should be aware that internally displaced thoracoamniotic shunts could contribute to refractory tension pneumothoraces and anticipate the need for advanced neonatal resuscitation, including early thoracocentesis or chest drain insertion. Furthermore, displaced shunts may require early surgical intervention.

"<b>Introduction</b>: STOPP (Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions) and START (Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment) are explicit criteria that facilitate medication review in multi-morbid older people in most clinical settings. This review examines the clinical trial evidence pertaining to STOPP/START criteria as an intervention.<b>Areas covered</b>: The literature was searched for registered clinical trials that used STOPP/START criteria as an intervention. In single-center trials, applying STOPP/START criteria improved medication appropriateness, reduced polypharmacy, reduced adverse drug reactions (ADRs), led to fewer falls, and lower medication costs. Two large-scale multi-center trials (SENATOR and OPERAM) examined the impact of computer-generated STOPP/START criteria on incident ADRs (SENATOR) and drug-related hospitalizations (OPERAM) in multi-morbid older people. Results of these trials will be publicized in 2020.<b>Expert opinion</b>: Applying STOPP/START criteria improves clinical outcomes in multi-morbid older people. Electronic deployment of STOPP/START criteria is a substantial technical challenge; however, recent clinical trials of software prototypes demonstrate feasibility. Even with well-functioning software for the application of STOPP/START criteria, the need remains for face-to-face interaction between attending clinicians and appropriately trained personnel (likely pharmacists) to explain and qualify specific STOPP/START recommendations in individual multi-morbid older patients.

"Autoantibodies and, less commonly, systemic rheumatic symptoms are associated with treatment with numerous medications and other types of ingested compounds. Distinct syndromes can be distinguished, based on clinical and laboratory features, as well as exposure history. Drug-induced lupus has been reported as a side-effect of long-term therapy with over 40 medications. Its clinical and laboratory features are similar to systemic lupus erythematosus, except that patients fully recover after the offending medication is discontinued. This syndrome differs from typical drug hypersensitivity reactions in that drug-specific T-cells or antibodies are not involved in induction of autoimmunity, it usually requires many months to years of drug exposure, is drug dose-dependent and generally does not result in immune sensitization to the drug. Circumstantial evidence strongly suggests that oxidative metabolites of the parent compound trigger autoimmunity. Several mechanisms for induction of autoimmunity will be discussed, including bystander activation of autoreactive lymphocytes due to drug-specific immunity or to non-specific activation of lymphocytes, direct cytotoxicity with release of autoantigens and disruption of central T-cell tolerance. The latter hypothesis will be supported by a mouse model in which a reactive metabolite of procainamide introduced into the thymus results in lupus-like autoantibody induction. These findings, as well as evidence for thymic function in drug-induced lupus patients, support the concept that abnormalities during T-cell selection in the thymus initiate autoimmunity.",15767026,Drug-induced lupus.,1,1
"Anniversaries of the identification of three human teratogens (i.e., rubella virus in 1941, thalidomide in 1961, and diethylstilbestrol in 1971) occurred in 2011. These experiences highlight the critical role that scientists with an interest in teratology play in the identification of teratogenic exposures as the basis for developing strategies for prevention of those exposures and the adverse outcomes associated with them. However, an equally important responsibility for teratologists is to evaluate whether medications and vaccines are safe for use during pregnancy so informed decisions about disease treatment and prevention during pregnancy can be made. Several recent studies have examined the safety of medications during pregnancy, including antiviral medications used to treat herpes simplex and zoster, proton pump inhibitors used to treat gastroesophageal reflux, and newer-generation antiepileptic medications used to treat seizures and other conditions. Despite the large numbers of pregnant women included in these studies and the relatively reassuring results, the question of whether these medications are teratogens remains. In addition, certain vaccines are recommended during pregnancy to prevent infections in mothers and infants, but clinical trials to test these vaccines typically exclude pregnant women; thus, evaluation of their safety depends on observational studies. For pregnant women to receive optimal care, we need to define the data needed to determine whether a medication or vaccine is ""safe"" for use during pregnancy. In the absence of adequate, well-controlled data, it will often be necessary to weigh the benefits of medications or vaccines with potential risks to the embryo or fetus.",22328359,Human teratogens update 2011: can we ensure safety during pregnancy?,1,1
"Perinatology is a dynamically developing field of medicine. The progress of technology in recent decades has made it possible to recognize birth defects very early, including those which are lethal or genetically determined. In many clinical situations, it is no longer possible to work alone to reach a definitive diagnosis, plan treatment or predict the clinical course of the affected fetus/newborn. There is a need for teamwork, which ensures the proper, early care starting in the fetal period, not only in the delivery room or NICU. This paper discusses the ethical foundations of creating interdisciplinary teams, taking as an example the Interdisciplinary Team for Fetal Malformation at the Institute of Mother and Child in Warsaw, which has been active for 25 years, and presents how it works in practice. On the basis of the clinical cases that are examined, practical guidelines were formulated for both the work of medical teams and the way parents are informed about the clinical situation of their child and about sharing the care after the birth of the child.

The mean mini-mental status exam score in the congenital scoliosis group was significantly lower than that in the adolescent idiopathic scoliosis group. Group analysis found that various brain areas of patients with congenital scoliosis showed glucose hypometabolisms in the left prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10), right orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann area 11), left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9), left anterior cingulate gyrus (Brodmann area 24) and pulvinar of the left thalamus.

Information on drug exposure was obtained by interview in early pregnancy. Associations between maternal drug use and infant cardiovascular defect were identified for insulin, antihypertensives, fertility drugs, erythromycin, naproxen, anticonvulsants, nitrofurantoin, clomipramine, and budesonide in nasal preparations.

"Drug interactions in clinical practice are common and have developed into an increasing challenge for the medical profession. Specifically antidepressant drugs (ADs), which are among the 5 most frequently prescribed drugs, are predestined for adverse drug interactions because of their multiple mechanisms of action and/or their influence on drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. Although selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and other new-generation ADs have an overall improved safety profile, their potential for drug interactions is to be considered. A review of the current literature has been performed, and selected examples of clinically relevant interactions with ADs have been chosen. With regard to pharmacodynamic interactions, the serotonin syndrome, the risk of bleeding under SSRI therapy, and the corrected Q-T interval prolongation are discussed in this review. The inhibitory effects of new-generation ADs on CYP enzymes show great variability and might be relevant for prescription recommendations in elderly patients and in patients with polypharmacy. The CYP-enzyme-inducing effect of St. John's wort, a popular over-the-counter herbal drug, may lead to decreased plasma levels of CYP substrates. When comparing prescription data and observed adverse drug events, there is fortunately a safety gap between the number of potential drug-drug interactions and the number of clinically observed side effects due to drug-drug interactions.",20829645,Antidepressants: clinically relevant drug interactions to be considered.,1,1

Pregnant dams were treated orally with UP446 at doses of 250, 500, and 1000 mg/kg/day during gestation. The number of resorptions, implantations, litter size, body weights, and skeletal development was evaluated. Maternal food intake and body, tissue, and placenta weight were also assessed. There were no statistically significant differences in implantation, congenital malformation, embryo-fetal mortalities, and fetuses sex ratios in all dosing groups of both species. Therefore, the no observed adverse effect level of UP446 was considered to be greater than 1000 mg/kg in both the maternal and fetus in both species.

The aim of this report is to describe the activity of Bergamo Teratology Information Service (TIS) in supporting the public and health-care personnel in case of drug prescriptions in suspected/confirmed COVID-19 pregnant and lactating patients during COVID-19 outbreak in Italy. Methods All Bergamo TIS requests concerning COVID-19 pregnant and lactating women have been retrospectively evaluated from 1 March to 15 April 2020. Type of medications, drug's safety profile and compatibility with pregnancy and lactation are reported. Results Our service received information calls concerning 48 (9 pregnant, 35 lactating) patients. Among pregnant and lactating women, the requests of information were related to 16 and 60 drugs prescriptions respectively. More than half concerned drugs prescriptions during the first and second trimester (13/16) and during the first six months of lactation (37/60). Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin were the most involved. Conclusions Hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin at dosages used for COVID-19 may be considered compatible and reasonably safe either in pregnancy and lactation. Antivirals may be considered acceptable in pregnancy. During lactation lopinavir and ritonavir probably exhibit some supportive data from literature that darunavir and cobicistat do not.

The proposed method was studied using 54 drugs and a probabilistic approach of performance evaluation using bootstrapping with 10,000 iterations.",32349656,Predicting potential adverse events using safety data from marketed drugs.,0,1
"Maternal diabetes preceding pregnancy may increase the risk of birth defects in the offspring, but not all studies confirm this association, which has shown considerable variation over time, and the effect of having type 1 versus type 2 diabetes is unclear. We conducted a population-based cohort study in the Northern Italy Emilia-Romagna region linking administrative databases with a Birth Defects Registry. From hospital discharge records we identified all diabetic pregnancies during 1997-2010, and a population of non-diabetic parturients matched for age, residence, year and delivery hospital. We collected available information on education, smoking and drug prescriptions, from which we inferred the type of diabetes. We found 62 malformed infants out of 2,269 births among diabetic women, and 162 out of 10,648 births among non-diabetic women. The age-standardized prevalence ratio (PR) of malformation associated with maternal pregestational diabetes was 1.79 (95 % confidence interval 1.34-2.39), a value that varied little by age. Type of diabetes strongly influenced the PR, with higher values related to type 2 diabetic women. Most major subgroups of anomalies had PRs above 1, including cardiovascular, genitourinary, musculoskeletal, and chromosomal abnormalities. There was an unusually high PR for the rare defect 'extra-ribs', but it was based on only two cases. This study indicates that maternal pregestational type 2 diabetes is associated with a higher prevalence of specific birth defects in offspring, whereas for type 1 diabetic mothers, particularly in recent years, the association was unremarkable.",24861339,Risk of birth defects associated with maternal pregestational diabetes.,0,0

"Maternal age effect is well-known in the origin of numerical chromosomal aberrations and some isolated congenital abnormalities (CAs). The sex ratio (SR), i.e. number of males divided by the number of males and females together, of most CAs deviates from the SR of newborn population (0.51). The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the possible association of maternal age with the SR of isolated CAs in a population-based large dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities, 1980-1996. First, SR of 24 CA entities/groups was estimated in 21,494 patients with isolated CA. In the next step SR of different maternal age groups was compared to the mean SR of the given CA-groups. The SR of four CA-groups showed some deviation in certain maternal age groups. Cases with anencephaly had female excess in young mothers (<25 years). Cases with skull's CAs particularly craniosynostosis had a male excess in cases born to women over 30 years. Two other CA groups (cleft lip ± palate and valvar pulmonic stenosis within the group of right-sided obstructive defect of heart) had significant deviation in SR of certain maternal age groups from the mean SR, but these deviations were not harmonized with joining age groups and thus were considered as a chance effect due to multiple testing. In conclusion, our study did not suggest that in general SR of isolated CAs might be modified by certain maternal age groups with some exception such as anencephaly and craniosynostosis.",25354028,Sex ratio of congenital abnormalities in the function of maternal age: a population-based study.,1,0

"The anatomy of ductus arteriosus (DA) can be varied in different congenital heart defects (CHDs), and it is difficult to fully discover the DA and other associated cardiac anomalies by prenatal ultrasound. This study was aimed to use the modified vascular corrosion casting technique to prepare fetal cardiovascular casts with DA anomalies, assess the casting effectiveness in evaluating the great vessels of the fetal heart and investigate the utility of cardiovascular casting for the demonstration of fetal DA abnormalities. This retrospective study enrolled fourteen fetuses (23 to 28<sup>+2</sup> gestational weeks) with severe CHDs diagnosed by prenatal echocardiography and casting technique from January 2013 to July 2019. The sonographic features of DAs were carefully observed and other associated cardiovascular anomalies were also evaluated during the screening. The architectures of DAs and the whole cardiovascular system were observed and analyzed, and then the cast findings were compared with prenatal ultrasonic results. In fourteen cases, 18 ductal abnormities were indicated by prenatal echocardiography in fourteen cases, while 25 were revealed by casting. Cast findings included 4 cases of ductal stenosis, 1 case of ductal dilation, 6 cases of ductal circuity, 3 cases of right-sided ductus, 5 cases of anomalous ductal connection, 1 case of bilateral ductus and 5 cases of absent ductus. Cast findings consisted with ultrasound in 10 ductal abnormalities, revealed additional 15 ductal abnormalities miss-diagnosed by sonography, and corrected 6 abnormalities misdiagnosed prenatally. Meanwhile, 3 ductal abnormalities (reversed flow) could not be demonstrated by casts but only by ultrasound. Cast models can visually display the anatomical characteristics of ductus arteriosus, and could be successfully used in the demonstration of ductus abnormalities in fetuses with severe CHDs.

"Birth defects (BD), also known as congenital anomalies, are structural or functional abnormalities present at birth as a result of abnormal prenatal development. Their cause can be broadly categorized as genetic, environmental, or a combination of both. It is estimated that approximately 3-6% of newborn infants worldwide are affected by BD, many of which are associated with serious morbidity, mortality, and lifelong disabilities. The International Clearinghouse for Birth Defects Surveillance and Research (ICBDSR), founded in 1974, promotes worldwide birth defect surveillance, research, and prevention through the ongoing sharing of data, expertise, and training. In this review, we show value and contribution of BD surveillance systems in pursuing these aims. In the time of personalized medicine for many rare and common diseases, there are still massive gaps in our understanding of the causes and mechanisms of many birth defects, especially structural congenital anomalies. The main aim of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), adopted by the United Nations in 2015, is to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all children. One specific goal is to end preventable deaths of newborns and children less than 5 years of age by 2030. The SDGs also underscore the need to consider BD as a priority in the global child health agenda. It can be said that counting BD helps BD to count. By sharing data and expertise and joining in surveillance and research, BD surveillance programs can play a major role in increasing our understanding of the causes of BD, and promoting prevention.",30229536,Value of sharing and networking among birth defects surveillance programs: an ICBDSR perspective.,1,0

"We investigated the effect of pregnane X receptor (PXR) polymorphisms on tacrolimus (FK506) blood trough concentrations and the associated adverse reactions in kidney transplantation recipients (KTRs). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-restriction fragment length polymorphism was used to detect the genotypes of single nucleotide polymorphism loci in 336 KTRs. The PXR six-base deletion mutation was classified using specific allele PCR, and the FK506 blood trough concentration in the KTRs was measured by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay. There were significant differences in adverse reactions resulting from FK506 in age, weight, body mass index (BMI) and treatment course (P < 0.05). Logistical regression revealed that the FK506 treatment course and BMI were risk factors for hyperlipidemia, and the risk of hyperlipidemia increased 27.534 times when the BMI was less than 18.5. Moreover, age was also a risk factor leading to hyperglycemia. FK506 blood trough concentration and C<sub>0</sub>/D value had an impact on adverse reactions induced by hyperglycemia. The KTRs' PXR rs3842689, rs6785049, and rs1523127 mutation frequencies were 26.07, 11.79, and 16.07%, respectively. There was no statistically significant difference in the mutation frequency of each locus between the control group and the adverse reaction groups. Therefore, rs3842689, 7635G>A (rs6785049), and 24381C>A (rs1523127) PXR polymorphisms have no obvious impact on FK506; furthermore, the PXR rs3842689 wild-type homozygous WW genotype is a risk factor of FK506 and results in gastrointestinal reactions.",27706725,Effect of pregnane X receptor polymorphisms on tacrolimus blood concentrations and the resulting adverse reactions in kidney transplantation recipients.,0,1
"The likelihood of a drug reaction with lamotrigine is increased by dose escalation that is too rapid or drug interactions that increase the concentration of lamotrigine. There is a well-documented interaction between valproic acid and lamotrigine in which lamotrigine levels are increased, subsequently increasing the risk of a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome. This syndrome is characterized by fever, lymphadenopathy, diffuse maculopapular rash, multivisceral involvement, eosinophilia, and atypical lymphocytes and has a mortality rate of 10-40%. We describe the first case, to our knowledge, of DRESS syndrome that was probably induced by a drug interaction between lamotrigine and ginseng. A 44-year-old white man presented to the emergency department after experiencing a possible seizure. His medical history included two other lifetime events concerning for seizures at ages 14 and 29 years old. After referral to the neurology clinic, he was diagnosed with generalized tonic-clonic seizure disorder, and lamotrigine was started with up-titration according to the drug's package insert to a goal dosage of 150 mg twice/day. The patient had also been taking deer antler velvet and ginseng that he continued during his lamotrigine therapy. On day 43 of therapy, the patient presented to the emergency department with a pruritic rash that had started on his extremities and spread to his torso. He was thought to have experienced a drug reaction to lamotrigine, and the drug was discontinued. Thirteen days later, the patient was admitted from the acute care clinic for inpatient observation due to laboratory abnormalities in the setting of continued rash, headache, and myalgias. His admission laboratory results on that day were remarkable for leukocytosis, with a white blood cell count up to 17.6 × 10(3) /mm(3) , with a prominent eosinophilia of 3.04 × 10(3) /mm(3) ; his liver enzyme levels were also elevated, with an aspartate aminotransferase level of 191 U/L, alanine aminotransferase level 473 U/L, alkaline phosphatase level 465 U/L, and total bilirubin level 1.4 mg/dl. Use of the Drug Interaction Probability Scale indicated that a drug interaction between lamotrigine and ginseng was the probable cause (score of 5). The proposed mechanism of the interaction is ginseng inhibition of the uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 2B7 enzyme, similar to the mechanism of the interaction with valproic acid. Clinicians should be aware of this probable drug interaction and avoid coadministration of ginseng and lamotrigine or use a more conservative dose titration of lamotrigine for patients who are also taking ginseng.

"Chromosomal abnormalities are more common in the presence of structural birth defects. However, much of the literature have only provided chromosomal abnormality rates for one or a few structural birth defects at a time. This study calculated the chromosomal abnormality rates for a number of structural birth defects using data from the Hawaii Birth Defects Program (HBDP) for deliveries during 1986-1999 and evaluated the impact of exclusion of cases with chromosomal abnormalities when calculating birth prevalence. The chromosomal abnormality rates were highest for endocardial cushion defect (40%) and omphalocele (27%), while no chromosomal abnormalities were reported for pyloric stenosis, persistent cloaca, and deficiency of lower limbs. The majority of chromosomal abnormality rates fell within a certain range, with 32 (63%) of the birth defect categories having chromosomal abnormality rates of 5-15%. The chromosomal abnormality rates also tended to be higher for multiple than for isolated cases. For three of the structural birth defects (ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, endocardial cushion defect), the birth prevalence of the defect, when cases with a chromosomal abnormality were excluded, was significantly lower than the birth prevalence that included those cases. Chromosomal abnormality rates varied by type of structural birth defect and presence of other major structural birth defects. For at least several structural birth defects, exclusion of cases with chromosomal abnormalities significantly underestimated the birth prevalence. This underestimation may be important, depending on the purpose of the analysis.",15264283,"Impact of excluding cases with known chromosomal abnormalities on the prevalence of structural birth defects, Hawaii, 1986-1999.",1,0

"Congenital cerebrovascular anomalies in the pediatric age group are myriad with diverse etiologies. The purpose of this paper is to provide an imaging overview of congenital vascular malformations and vascular tumors, as these conditions are varied and the characteristic vascular abnormality may even suggest the underlying systemic condition in helping to guide further management. For example, the identification of an arterial anomaly such as agenesis/hypoplasia/duplication may warrant further evaluation for an associated syndrome. Recognition of other pertinent findings, such as persistent carotid-vertebrobasilar anastomoses for instance, would be particularly important for the planning of potential embolization/coiling of associated vascular malformation and/or aneurysm. Awareness of congenital dural sinus anomalies, including hypoplasia, aplasia, and or duplication, prevents the incorrect or overdiagnosis of sinus thrombosis. Moreover, multiple developmental venous anomalies in a patient may require further investigation for its familial association. In a similar context, there may be familial association with multiple cavernous malformations and children with central nervous system vascular malformations may have an association with other vascular conditions, eg, hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, etc. An accurate description of vascular lesions is critical for understanding the natural history of the disease process and ultimately for guiding treatment. An important example of this includes Sturge-Weber syndrome, which is often incorrectly viewed as an arteriovenous malformation, but actually a type of venous malformation. Another example which is important to recognize includes the differentiation between an infantile hemangioma and a vascular malformation, particularly as the course of the pathology and the treatment is so different between the two.",30378722,Pediatric Congenital Cerebrovascular Anomalies.,1,0

"Drug bioavailability to the developing brain is a major concern in the treatment of neonates and infants as well as pregnant and breast-feeding women. Central adverse drug reactions can have dramatic consequences for brain development, leading to major neurological impairment. Factors setting the cerebral bioavailability of drugs include protein-unbound drug concentration in plasma, local cerebral blood flow, permeability across blood-brain interfaces, binding to neural cells, volume of cerebral fluid compartments, and cerebrospinal fluid secretion rate. Most of these factors change during development, which will affect cerebral drug concentrations. Regarding the impact of blood-brain interfaces, the blood-brain barrier located at the cerebral endothelium and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier located at the choroid plexus epithelium both display a tight phenotype early on in embryos. However, the developmental regulation of some multispecific efflux transporters that also limit the entry of numerous drugs into the brain through barrier cells is expected to favor drug penetration in the neonatal brain. Finally, drug cerebral bioavailability is likely to be affected following perinatal injuries that alter blood-brain interface properties.

However, because more than half of pregnancies are unplanned, these methods are not generalizable across the population. Thus, better interventions are urgently needed.

"Piperine has been associated with neuroprotective effects and monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibition, thus being an attractive scaffold to develop new antiparkinsonian agents. Accordingly, we prepared a small library of piperine derivatives and screened the inhibitory activities towards human MAO isoforms (hMAO-A and hMAO-B). Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies pointed out that the combination of α-cyano and benzyl ester groups increased both potency and selectivity towards hMAO-B. Kinetic experiments with compounds 7, 10 and 15 indicated a competitive hMAO-B inhibition mechanism. Compounds 15 and 16, at 10 μM, caused a small but significant decrease in P-gp efflux activity in Caco-2 cells. Compound 15 stands out as the most potent piperine-based hMAO-B inhibitor (IC<sub>50</sub> = 47.4 nM), displaying favourable drug-like properties and a broad safety window.

"β-ionone (BIO) is used in fragrances, toiletries and non-cosmetic products, and as a flavor food additive. Notwithstanding the widespread human exposure, there are limited data on the reproductive toxicity of BIO. This study evaluated the developmental toxicity of BIO (0, 125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg body weight/day) given orally to rats on days 6-15 of gestation (GD6-15). C-section was on GD21 and implantations, living and dead fetuses and resorptions were recorded. Fetuses were weighed, and examined for external abnormalities and skeleton and visceral anomalies. The embryotoxicity of a single oral dose of BIO (1000 mg/kg body wt) given on GD11 was evaluated as well. At the highest dose, BIO reduced weight gain and produced chromodacryorrhea and other signs of toxicity. BIO did not increase the frequency of malformations nor did it retard fetal growth. Nonetheless, BIO decreased the pregnancy rate in the group of females exposed on GD6-15, and increased the resorption rate in those treated on GD11 only. In conclusion, except for a higher embryolethality at a maternally toxic dose, BIO caused no embryotoxic effect over the dose range tested and the study NOAEL for maternal and developmental toxicity was 500 mg of BIO/ kg of body weight/day.",29928934,Study on the developmental toxicity of β-ionone in the rat.,1,1

"<b>Objective:</b> The study aimed to estimate the rate of genetic causes that were undetectable by Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) test in prenatally diagnosed congenital heart defect (CHD) cases based on an assumption that cfDNA would accurately detect common aneuploidies including trisomy 21/18/13/45X, and del22q11.2.<b>Methods:</b> This study included prenatally diagnosed CHD cases with diagnostic genetic results. The possibility of false-positive/negative results from cfDNA testing was discarded. Thus, cfDNA results would be positive in common aneuploidies or del22q11.2 and negative in normal diagnostic genetic testing results or other genetic conditions. The rate of genetic causes that were undetectable by cfDNA test was estimated for all cases as well as for CHD subgroups.<b>Results:</b> Of 302 cases, 98 (34.8%) had a type of genetic abnormalities, with 67 having common aneuploidies or del22q11.2 and 31 having other genetic conditions. The rate of genetic causes that were undetectable by cfDNA test in CHD cases was 13.2% among those with assumingly negative cfDNA screen results and 10.3% among the entire study population. These rates were similar between CHD subgroups (<i>p</i> > .05). The rate of genetic causes that were undetectable by cfDNA test was higher in the non-isolated cases than in the isolated ones among those with assumingly negative-screen results (20.5% and 9.9%, respectively, <i>p</i> = .025).<b>Conclusion:</b> In prenatally diagnosed CDH cases, a significant number of chromosomal abnormalities are still identified after diagnostic testing even if cfDNA screen is negative, and thus it is important to extensively counsel patients with negative cfDNA screen carrying a CHD-affected fetus.",32338089,The rate of undetectable genetic causes by Cell-free DNA test in congenital heart defects.,1,0
"The visual system is very sensitive to side effects of medicines, either regarding systematic complications of eye drops or ocular complications following oral or intravenous treatments. For the latter, ophthalmologic regular monitoring is mostly the best preventive measure since most of iatrogenic abnormalities are reversible after ruling out the treatment. However, some ocular complications are poorly reversible, as for example with antimalarial drugs or vigabatrin. Concerning systemic complications of ocular treatments, their risk is often underestimated, while the passage of drugs in the blood can sometimes reach similar rates than those observed after an oral administration, as it is the case with some beta-blockers ophthalmic solutions.

"According to the March of Dimes, approximately 4% (1/28) of babies are born in the US each year with a birth defect. For the majority of birth defects the etiology is unknown, although chemicals, including drug exposures, probably account for less than 1% of all birth defects. The identification of potential human teratogenicity during drug development is important because drug-induced adverse fetal effects are potentially preventable with the application of risk assessment strategies and risk minimization tools and programs to minimize risk of pregnancy exposure while preserving access to drug benefits; risk assessment and risk minimization together comprise risk management. It is important that risk minimization programs intended to limit fetal exposure use a consistent approach and are tailored to the product-specific risk concerns in order to optimize the benefit-risk balance for a particular drug.

"Investigation of the occurrence time of adverse drug reactions helps to prevent the development and aggravation of adverse reactions, but the expression time of ganciclovir-induced adverse events has not been elucidated. In this study, using databases of spontaneous adverse event reports, the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database (JADER) and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), the incidence of adverse reactions due to ganciclovir and their expression time were analyzed. As a result of calculation of the reporting odds ratio (ROR) and 95% confidence interval for individual main adverse reactions of ganciclovir (cytopenia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, liver damage, and acute renal failure), a signal was detected for all adverse reactions in both databases, except for liver damage in JADER. Furthermore, the Weibull distribution was performed for the analysis of onset time of each ganciclovir-induced adverse event. The results of Weibull parameter α and β values of each adverse event in both JADER and FAERS suggested that most adverse events occurred within 30 d and classified into the early failure type, except that thrombocytopenia and acute renal failure in JADER classified into the random failure type. Based on these findings, it concluded that the paying attention to signs of each ganciclovir-induced adverse event is required from the early phase after ganciclovir administration. However, in FAERS, development after a long-term course also accounted for 11%, suggesting that long-term periodic monitoring of adverse reactions would be also required.",31685764,Evaluation of the Expression Time of Ganciclovir-Induced Adverse Events Using JADER and FAERS.,0,1

"In this review, we have highlighted the adverse drug reaction mediated by transporters from two aspects: (1) competitive interactions between drug and drug/metabolite/endogenous substance mediated by transporters; (2) the expression/function change of transporter due to physiologic factors, disease, and drugs induction. It indicated that transporters exhibited a broad substrate specificity with a degree of overlap, which could change the pharmacokinetics of drugs and cause toxicity due to competition interactions among substrates. In addition, the expression and function of transporters were regulated by physiological conditions, pathological conditions, and drugs induction, which could cause adverse drug reaction and interindividual differences. Furthermore, one substrate was always medicated by several transporters and often subjected to metabolism by CYP enzymes, so we should be more aware of the increased plasma concentration of drugs caused by drug transporters as well as drug metabolizing enzymes synergistically, especially for drugs with narrow therapeutic window. In addition, the weightiness for one transporter to induce drugs plasma/tissue concentration change could be different in different condition. On the whole, transporters were corresponding with systemic/organs exposure of drug/metabolites/endogenous compounds. So understanding the expression and function in drug transporters will result in better strategies for optimal dosage regimen and reduce the risk for drug adverse reaction as well as adverse drug-drug interactions.",23338766,The impact of drug transporters on adverse drug reaction.,0,0
"EMLA cream was developed to reduce pain during pulsed-dye laser (PDL) treatment; however, no standard assessment for the therapeutic outcomes of PDL with EMLA creams thus far available. This comparative, prospective clinical trial evaluates laser efficacy and pain reduction during PDL treatment with EMLA cream for local topical anesthesia. Nineteen patients with untreated port-wine stain (PWS) were treated using PDL and examined in this study. Treatment specifications included Vbeam® PDL (Candela Corp.), 595-nm wavelength, 9 J/cm<sup>2</sup> radiant exposure, 0.45 ms pulse duration, 10 mm spot size, and cryogen spray cooling (40 ms cooling plus a 20 ms delay). A topical anesthetic (EMLA cream: 2.5% lidocaine and 2.5% prilocaine) and a placebo were applied to two respective testing areas on all patients prior to treatment. The visual analog scale (VAS) was used for pain assessment. Clinical therapeutic outcomes were evaluated by visual evaluation and with the use of a chromameter 2 months after 3PDL treatments. The average VAS scores were 3.15 ± 0.95 and 8 ± 0.57 for the EMLA cream site and the placebo site, respectively, at a significance level p < 0.001. The EMLA cream site and the placebo site had clearance or fading rates of 45.08 and 44.12%, respectively (p < 0.05). No serious side effects were reported. Patients reported a consistent decrease in pain during PDL treatment when the topical anesthetic EMLA cream was administered. Treatment of PWS by PDL with EMLA cream does not lead to a decrease in efficacy or an increase in side effects; instead, it significantly reduces pain during treatment.

"A multitude of factors can affect drug response in individuals. It is now well established that variations in genes, especially those coding for drug metabolising enzymes, can alter the pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic profile of a drug, impacting on efficacy and often resulting in drug-induced toxicity. The UDRUGS study is an initiative from the Carney Centre for Pharmacogenomics to biobank DNA and store associated clinical data from patients who have suffered rare and/or serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs).

".Fluoroquinolones are a kind of synthetic drugs commonly used in clinical treatment. They have good broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are not only convenient to administer, but also have remarkable therapeutic effects. In this paper, we selected 70 patients with adverse reactions of central nervous system during the use of fluoroquinolones as the research object. We reviewed and analyzed the basic data, main manifestations and outcomes of adverse reactions, and summarized the influencing factors. The results showed that dizziness, irritability and insomnia were the main symptoms in 42 patients with mild adverse reactions. In 28 patients with moderate to severe adverse reactions, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as restlessness, depression, nervous excitation, phonism and hallucination were found. 54 patients were able to recover after stopping the medication. The remaining 16 patients were treated with drugs, and the effective rate was 87.5%. By analyzing the related factors, it can be seen that elderly patients over 60 years old, intravenous administration, combination of drugs and past history of neurological diseases are the main factors leading to adverse reactions of the central nervous system. In this survey, there were 7 kinds of adverse drug reactions, of which 31 cases (44.28%) were caused by levofloxacin. Therefore, fluoroquinolones have adverse effects on the central nervous system in the course of treatment, and the occurrence of adverse reactions is related to patients' age, route of administration, drug combination and past history of illness.

"Immuno-oncology (IO) approaches such as cytokine therapy, immune-checkpoint blockers (ICBs), cancer vaccines, and cell-based therapies have revolutionized cancer treatment. ICBs provide better response-to-toxicity profile among various IO approaches; however, they can cause dysregulation of host immune system resulting in immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs). The skin and gastrointestinal system are most commonly affected. Although reversible, imAEs may cause life-threatening conditions if untreated. Risk assessment and appropriate patient selection before treatment initiation may prevent most imAEs. Key factors in effectively managing imAEs include baseline clinical evaluation, appropriate diagnostic tests, severity grading, timely decision on discontinuation or reintroduction of ICB treatment, and intervention with immunosuppressive and/or immunomodulatory agents. Patient and healthcare provider awareness is critical for identifying and managing lower grade imAEs. Immediate reporting is important for successfully managing and preventing or worsening of imAEs. Pretreatment sensitization of patients should address barriers to reporting such as fear of ICB discontinuation, ignorance of symptoms, financial constraints, and self-medication. Physicians should rely on clinical presentation and diagnostic work-up (including imaging) to accurately identify, characterize, and differentiate imAEs from metastasis. Treatment-related new symptoms should be dealt with a high level of suspicion. Corticosteroids are initiated if symptoms do not resolve within a week from onset and tapered over a month to avoid rebound of symptoms. ICB therapy should be permanently discontinued in most cases of grade 3-4 imAEs. A multidisciplinary approach involving oncologists, oncosurgeons, primary care physicians, and nurses is necessary in effectively managing imAEs and facilitating better clinical outcomes.",31793438,"Adverse effects of immuno-oncology drugs-Awareness, diagnosis, and management: A literature review of immune-mediated adverse events.",0,1
"An association between congenital malformations and fetal growth restriction (FGR) can be largely explained by a relationship with early embryonic hypocellularity. The malformations include the VACTERL association, which is exceptional as a Mendelian syndrome, but is commonly associated with monozygotic twinning, maternal diabetes, and some forms of aneuploidy, all characterized by a small embryo early in development. Parsimony suggests that these different links to VACTERL are related to the hypocellularity as a single common factor, rather than as an expression of three independent pathogenetic processes. A distinct non-genetic pathogenesis is further supported by increased frequencies in the same conditions of a single umbilical artery (SUA), which is also unusual in Mendelian disorders. SUA often involves the atrophy of one artery, which may be facilitated by altered hemodynamics in a smaller embryo, providing a direct link to hypocellularity. Hypocellularity may also explain a possible connection between VACTERL and certain mitochondrial disorders, where reduced energy might slow early cell division and growth, reducing the size of the embryo. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27717162,"Embryonic hypocellularity, blastogenetic malformations, and fetal growth restriction.",0,0

Our main question in this paper was whether the efficiency of drug target proteins to spread perturbations in the human interactome is larger if the binding drugs have side effects, as compared to those which have no reported side effects. Our results showed that in general, drug targets were better spreaders of perturbations than non-target proteins, and in particular, targets of drugs with side effects were also better spreaders of perturbations than targets of drugs having no reported side effects in human protein-protein interaction networks. Colorectal cancer-related proteins were good spreaders and had a high centrality, while type 2 diabetes-related proteins showed an average spreading efficiency and had an average centrality in the human interactome. Moreover, the interactome-distance between drug targets and disease-related proteins was higher in diabetes than in colorectal cancer.

"The integrity of the paternal genome is essential as the spermatozoon can bring genetic damage into the oocyte at fertilization and contribute to the development of abnormal pregnancy outcome. During the past two decades, many assays have been developed to measure sperm DNA strand breaks, chromatin structure and compaction and assess the proteins associated with the DNA, as well as epigenetic modifications. Using these assays, it has been shown that exposure to physical agents or chemicals, including therapeutic drugs and environmental toxicants, can affect the integrity of sperm chromatin, inducing structural, genetic and/or epigenetic abnormalities. The mechanisms by which such damage is triggered are still largely unresolved and the susceptibility of each individual will depend on their genetic background, lifestyle and exposure to various insults. Depending on the nature of the chemicals, they may directly target the DNA, induce an oxidative stress, or modify the epigenetic elements. The significance of measuring the sperm chromatin integrity comes from the fact that this end-point correlates well with the low IVF and ICSI outcomes, and idiopathic infertility.

"This study has mainly a descriptive aim, in which crude prevalence of minor skeletal congenital defects is calculated and sex differences are tested. Prevalence is compared with other studies to recognize regional patterns. Association with age-at-death and year-of-birth is tested to identify impact of environmental stress on minor congenital defects presence. Testing association between defects will identify defects with a probable identical etiology. Chi-square was used to identify sex differences, between studies differences, and to test relationships between defects and Spearman correlation to verify correlation intensity. T-test was used to test age-at-death and year-of-birth differences in defects prevalence. There were no statistically significant differences in prevalence of minor skeletal defects for sex and age-at-death. There were statistically significant differences in year-of-birth for sternal aperture and pectus excavatum (crude prevalence was higher for those who were born earlier). There was a statistical significant association between pectus excavatum and manubrium mesosternal joint and atlas posterior/lateral bridging and notochord defects. For most defects, this study has lower prevalence than other studies. From 18 minor axial skeletal congenital defects analyzed, prevalence ranges from absent to 26.3 (notochord defects). Pectus excavatum and manubrium mesosternal joint might have a similar etiology as well as atlas posterior/lateral bridging and notochord defects. This study has lower prevalence, for almost all defects, than other studies. None of the minor congenital defects tested might, at this time, be considered useful stress markers.",32161938,Minor sternum and vertebral column congenital defects in Lisbon Identified Skeletal Collection.,0,0

"Cancer treatment plans mainly include chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, which exert serious adverse reactions immediately or during the long term after cancer therapy in many patients. In several cases, treatment-related adverse effects outweigh treatment benefits and worsen the patient's condition. This problem is not avoidable with current cancer therapy procedures; therefore, improved understanding and earlier prevention and reversion of treatment-related complications are particularly important before the lesions become progressive and irreversible. Mesenchymal stromal cell therapy is very promising in recent clinical research and investigations. Their potential properties such as regenerative and reparative functions and anti-inflammatory activity make them proper candidates for cell therapy to recover cancer patients from treatment-related adverse effects or may even prevent them. This article discuss benefits of applying human mesenchymal stromal cell therapy after current cancer treatment plans, with the purpose of prevention and healing of adverse reactions, faster patient recovery after radio/chemotherapy, reducing rates of treatment failure and cancer recurrence and increasing patient quality of life after treatment cessation.

"Safety information regarding drug use during pregnancy is insufficient. The present study aimed to establish an optimal signal detection method to identify adverse drug reactions in pregnant women and to evaluate information in the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database between April 2004 and November 2014. We identified reports on pregnant women using the Standardised MedDRA Queries. We calculated the proportional reporting ratio (PRR) and reporting odds ratio (ROR) of the risk factors for the two known risks of antithyroid drugs and methimazole (MMI) embryopathy, and ritodrine and fetal/infant cardiovascular events. The PRR and ROR values differed between all reports in the JADER database and those on pregnant women, affecting whether signal detection criteria were met. Therefore we considered that reports on pregnant women should be used when risks associated with pregnancy were determined using signal detection. Analyses of MMI embryopathy revealed MMI signals [PRR, 159.7; ROR, 669.9; 95% confidence interval (CI), 282.4-1588.7] but no propylthiouracil signals (PRR, 1.98; ROR, 2.0; 95%CI, 0.3-15.4). These findings were consistent with those of reported risks. Analyses of fetal/infant cardiovascular events revealed ritodrine signals (PRR, 2.1; ROR, 2.1; 95%CI, 1.4-3.3).

"The contribution of all key healthcare professionals is vital to promote an efficient adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system. In this context, nurses are important as they are in a better position to observe a patient's response regarding the drug therapy and to report an ADR. The aim of the study was to explore the perspectives of nurses about ADR reporting system in Lahore, Pakistan. A total of 21 nurses were interviewed. The thematic content analysis of the qualitative interviews yielded six major themes and eight subthemes. Major themes included: (1) Knowledge about the concept of the medication safety & the ADR; (2) Knowledge regarding pharmacovigilance activities; (3) Willingness to report; (4) Practices related to the ADR reporting; (5) Barriers to the ADR reporting; (6) Facilitators to the ADR reporting. The majority of the nurses were aware of medicine safety and ADRs, but in many cases, they were unable to report these ADRs. The study pointed out considerable concerns regarding the knowledge and practices of nurses about pharmacovigilance activities in their workplace, mainly due to increased workload, due to the absence of a reporting system and legal liability. The main challenges turned out to be the lack of knowledge and training, as well as the implementation of guidelines.

"The QT interval in electrocardiogram (ECG) reflects the total duration of ventricular myocardial depolarization and repolarization. It has been well recognized that many condition may cause QT interval prolongation. Unfortunately, numbers of cardiac and non-cardiac drug prolong the QT interval and cause a distinctive polymorphic ventricular tachycardia termed torsade de pointes (TdP). TdP can degenerate into ventricular fibrillation, which leads to sudden cardiac death. Recently various regulatory and clinical bodies of Europe, USA, Canada and Australia have made their focus on the drugs that induce prolongation of QT interval. Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) of the European Agency issued a document entitled 'Points to Consider: The assessment of the potential for QT interval prolongation by non-cardiovascular medicinal products' [1, 2]. In addition, USFDA adopted the guideline 'Clinical evaluation of QT/QTc interval prolongation and proarrhythmic potential for non-anti arrhythmic drugs' [3]. These documents and guidelines are primarily concern with development of novel agents and the new use or new dose of already approved drugs. The scope of this guideline is to study the effect of drugs on QT prolongation and give idea of evaluation of drug's effects on QT prolongation. Today more than 50 available drugs (both old and new) have been identify, which prolong the QT interval [1]. Several drugs have been withdrawn from many countries on this basis but many of these drugs are still available in Indian market and potentially creating life-threatening arrhythmias.

"<b>Background</b> There are different treatment options for ocular toxoplasmosis (OT). ""Classic"" therapy consists of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid combined with systemic steroids and is still widely used. However, potentially severe side effects of this therapy have been reported. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence and types of adverse drug reactions in patients treated for OT. Clinical management of each adverse drug reaction was assessed. <b>Patients and Methods</b> In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed data of patients with OT, who were consecutively examined between December 2011 and December 2015 at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Zurich. <b>Results</b> In total, 49 patients had at least one episode of active OT. In 54 (83.0 %) of 65 treated episodes, the classic regimen was used. Of the 37 patients who received classic treatment, 9 (24.3 %) developed at least one adverse drug reaction which led to drug discontinuation, including elevated creatinine (5.4 %), elevated liver enzymes (5.4 %), vomiting (5.4 %), rash (5.4 %) and facial swelling (2.7 %).

"The growing global production of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnONPs) suggests a realistic increase in the environmental exposure to such a nanomaterial, making the knowledge of its biological reactivity and its safe-by-design synthesis mandatory. In this study, the embryotoxicity of ZnONPs (1-100 mg/L) specifically synthesized for industrial purposes with different sizes, shapes (round, rod) and surface coatings (PEG, PVP) was tested using the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX) to identify potential target tissues and the most sensitive developmental stages. The ZnONPs did not cause embryolethality, but induced a high incidence of malformations, in particular misfolded gut and abdominal edema. Smaller, round NPs were more effective than the bigger, rod ones, and PEGylation determined a reduction in embryotoxicity. Ingestion appeared to be the most relevant exposure route. Only the embryos exposed from the stomodeum opening showed anatomical and histological lesions to the intestine, mainly referable to a swelling of paracellular spaces among enterocytes. In conclusion, ZnONPs differing in shape and surface coating displayed similar toxicity in X. laevis embryos and shared the same target organ.

"Vitamin K antagonists (VKA) are known to act as teratogens; however, there is still uncertainty about the relative risk for birth defects and the most sensitive period. In a multi-centre (n = 12), observational, prospective study we compared 666 pregnant women exposed to phenprocoumon (n = 280), acenocoumarol (n = 226), fluindione (n = 99), warfarin (n = 63) and phenindione (n = 2) to a non-exposed control group (n = 1,094). Data were collected by institutes collaborating in the European Network of Teratology Information Services (ENTIS) during individual risk counselling between 1988 and 2004. Main outcome measures were coumarin embryopathy and other birth defects, miscarriage rate, birth-weight, and prematurity. The rate of major birth defects after 1st trimester exposure was significantly increased (OR 3.86, 95% CI 1.86-8.00). However, there were only two coumarin embryopathies (0.6%; both phenprocoumon). Prematurity was more frequent (16.0% vs. 7.6%, OR 2.61, 95% CI 1.76-3.86), mean gestational age at delivery (37.9 vs.39.4, p<0.001), and mean birth weight of term infants (3,166 g vs. 3,411 g; p < 0.001) were lower compared to the controls. Using the methodology of survival analysis, miscarriage rate reached 42% vs. 14% (hazard ratio 3.36; 95% CI 2.28-4.93).

The risk for coumarin embryopathy is, however, very small, in particular when therapy during the 1(st) trimester did not take place later than week 8 after the 1(st) day of the last menstrual period. Therefore, elective termination of a wanted pregnancy is not recommended if (inadvertent) exposure took place in early pregnancy.

We hypothesized that pregnant women are not receiving deworming treatment and we aimed to identify barriers to World Health Organization guideline implementation. We conducted key informant interviews with local Department of Health (DOH) administrators, focus group discussions with nurses, midwives, and health care workers, and knowledge, attitudes, and practices surveys with women of reproductive age to elicit perspectives about deworming during pregnancy. Key informant interviews revealed that healthcare workers were not deworming pregnant women due to inadequate drug supply, infrastructure and personnel as well as fear of teratogenicity. Focus group discussions showed that healthcare workers similarly had not implemented guidelines due to infrastructure challenges and concerns for fetal malformations. The majority of local women believed that STH treatment causes side effects (74.8%) as well as maternal harm (67.3%) and fetal harm (77.9%). Women who were willing to take anthelminthics while pregnant had significantly greater knowledge as demonstrated by higher Treatment Scores (mean rank 146.92 versus 103.1, z = -4.40, p<0.001) and higher Birth Defect Scores (mean rank 128.09 versus 108.65, z = -2.43, p = 0.015). This study concludes that World Health Organization guidelines are not being implemented in the Philippines. Infrastructure, specific protocols, and education for providers and patients regarding anthelminthic treatment are necessary for the successful prevention of STH morbidity and mortality among pregnant women.

"<b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate and describe the spectrum and rate of congenital thoracic malformations (CTMs) diagnosed by early prenatal sonography (gestational age (GA) less than 16 weeks). <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective, cross-sectional analysis of prenatal ultrasound screening tests in a community-based clinic. <b>Results:</b> In 2001-2017, 31 261 prenatal ultrasound tests detected 31 CTMs at a gestational age of 15.2 (range, 11.6-16.0) weeks. The most common malformation was congenital pleural effusion (CPE) (15 fetuses, 0.48/1000), followed by congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) (10 fetuses, 0.32/1000). Pulmonary hypoplasia (PH), congenital pulmonary airway malformation and broncho-pulmonary sequestration appeared in much smaller proportions (three, two and one fetuses, respectively). Most CTMs were associated with additional fetal lesions (15 fetuses, 48%). All early CDH (10 fetuses) and PH (three fetuses) and 6/15 with CPE had termination of pregnancy or missed abortions. <b>Conclusions:</b> Prenatal ultrasound before 16 GA was able to detect CTMs in 0.99/1000 of screening ultrasound (US) performed. Most CTMs tended to appear with multiple lesions and were associated with unfavorable outcomes.

"We present a 64-year-old woman who had a congenital defect of the nasal septal cartilage and vomeral bone. She noticed her nasal tip was collapsed approximately 2 months before consultation. Computed tomography showed the absence of cartilaginous septum and vomeral bone, and radiograph showed a depression in the anterior nasal floor and hypoplasia of anterior nasal spine. She had no history of maxillofacial trauma, disease, or surgery in the midface. Fiberendoscopic examination of nasal cavity showed normal mucosa without signs of chronic inflammatory diseases such as Wegener's granulomatosis. Her intelligence was normal, and no anomaly was observed in the cranial region. Blood examination showed negative including serologic tests for syphilis. No other systemic findings were found, and none of her relatives were similarly afflicted. From these findings, we concluded that the patient did not have Binder's syndrome (or she has, at least, a new variant of Binder's syndrome).

"Identification of serious adverse drug reactions (sADRS) associated with commonly used drugs can elude detection for years. Reye's syndrome (RS), nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF), and pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) among chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were recognized in 1951, 2000, and 1998, respectively. Reports associating these syndromes with aspirin, gadodiamide, and epoetin, were published 29, 6, and 4 years later, respectively. We obtained primary information from clinicians who identified causes of these sADRs and reviewed factors contributing to delayed identification of these toxicities. Overall, 3,500 aspirin-associated RS cases in the United States, 1,605 gadolinium-associated NSF cases, and 181 epoetin-associated PRCA cases were reported. Delays in FDA regulation of over-the- counter medications and administration of aspirin to children contributed to development of RS. For NSF, in 1996, the Danish Medicine Agency approved high-dose gadodiamide administration to chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients undergoing MR scans. Overall, 88 % of Danish NSF cases were from two hospitals and 97 % of United States' NSF cases were from 60 hospitals. These hospitals frequently administered high-doses of gadodiamide to CKD patients. Another factor was the decision to administer linear chelated contrast agents versus lower risk macrocyclic chelated agents. For PRCA, increased use of subcutaneous epoetin formulations to CKD patients, in part due to convenience and cost-savings considerations, and a European regulatory requirement requiring removal of albumin as a stabilizer, led to toxicity. Overall, 81, 13, and 17 years elapsed between drug introduction into practice and identification of a causal relationship for aspirin, erythropoietin, and gadodiamide, respectively. A substantial decline in new cases of these sADRs occurred within two years of identification of the offending drug.

"Abnormalities in cardiac conduction can occur due to a variety of factors. So called ""idiopathic"", conduction system degeneration develops without evident causes and may have hereditary basis. In the majority of cases it has no clinical manifestation, do not require treatment and have overall good prognosis. In this review we focus on congenital complete atrioventricular block and progressive cardiac conduction defect - rare but malignant and potentially lethal conditions that can be caused by genetic mutations and may be isolated or associated with structural heart disease. Cardiac involvement is relatively common in rare hereditary diseases - myodystrophies and mitochondrial cytopathies. Conduction abnormalities are among the most severe manifestations that may determine prognosis in these rare genetic disorders. These conditions deserve special consideration because of rapid progression of conduction defects and high prevalence of sudden cardiac death if no appropriate treatment applied.",26502508,[Congenital Cardiac Conduction Abnormalities].,1,0

"Breakpoint cluster region-Abelson murine leukemia (BCR-ABL) inhibitors markedly improve the prognosis of chronic myeloid leukemia. However, high treatment adherence is necessary for successful treatment with BCR-ABL inhibitors. Therefore, an adequate understanding of the adverse event profiles of BCR-ABL inhibitors is essential. Although many adverse events are observed in trials, an accurate identification of adverse events based only on clinical trial results is difficult because of strict entry criteria or limited follow-up durations. In particular, BCR-ABL inhibitor-induced impaired glucose metabolism remains controversial. Pharmacovigilance evaluations using spontaneous reporting systems are useful for analyzing drug-related adverse events in clinical settings. Therefore, we conducted signal detection analyses for BCR-ABL inhibitor-induced impaired glucose metabolism by using the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report (JADER) database. Signals for an increased reporting rate of impaired glucose metabolism were detected only for nilotinib use, whereas these signals were not detected for other BCR-ABL inhibitors. Subgroup analyses showed a clearly increased nilotinib-associated reporting rate of impaired glucose metabolism in male and younger patients. Although FAERS- and JADER-based signal detection analyses cannot determine causality perfectly, our study suggests the effects on glucose metabolism are different between BCR-ABL inhibitors and provides useful information for the selection of appropriate BCR-ABL inhibitors.",30561126,Pharmacovigilance evaluation of the relationship between impaired glucose metabolism and BCR-ABL inhibitor use by using an adverse drug event reporting database.,0,0

"With advancing age there is an increase in the disease burden and thus in the number of drugs prescribed to this patient group. It is often assumed that an increase in pill count is associated per se with an increase in the number of medication errors (e.g., potentially inappropriate prescribing, PIP) and the frequency of adverse drug events (ADE). However, prescribing more drugs can also mean more successful treatment, making it important to critically assess the benefit/risk balance of the medications prescribed in each patient. Whether a prescribed medication is appropriate depends on the clinical state of the patient (diagnoses), treatment goals, comedication/drug interactions, patient preferences, whether the patient tolerates the drug, a measure of how frail the patient is, etc. It is often argued that the number of prescribed drugs should be restricted, but we hold the view that this should only be done after careful consideration of the factors mentioned above. In our study, we remodeled the findings of two large cohort studies investigating the association between the number of drugs prescribed and clinical endpoints. The graphic illustrations obtained confirmed that targeting pill count, as a measure to reduce ADEs and mortality, fails to impact patient well-being because the number of drugs prescribed is likely determined by patient characteristics affecting drug response, namely, disease burden, patient functionality, and specific patient needs, all of which must be taken into account in order to reduce the risk of PIMs and the occurrence ADEs. .",30369395,Pill-count and the arithmetic of risk: Evidence that polypharmacy is a health status marker rather than a predictive surrogate for the risk of adverse drug events.,0,0

"The pharmacological effects of a drug depend on its concentration at the site of action, and therefore on the concentration in blood and on the dose. The relationship between the concentration or dose and the corresponding effect can usually be represented mathematically as a rectangular hyperbola; when effect is plotted against log concentration or log dose, the curve is sigmoidal. Inevitably, the effect size and the doses causing benefit and harm will differ among individuals, since they are biological phenomena: some individuals are more likely than others to suffer harm at any given dose. Some harmful effects can occur at much lower doses than those used in therapeutics; that is, the log dose-response curve for harm lies far to the left of the log dose-response curve for benefit. Those who suffer such reactions are hypersusceptible. When the dose-response curves for harm and therapeutic effect are in the same range, dose cannot separate the harmful effects from the therapeutic effects, and adverse reactions are collateral. Toxic effects occur when harmful doses are above the doses needed for benefit. In this review we consider factors that influence a subject's susceptibility to adverse drug reactions. Determinants of susceptibility include Immunological, Genetic, demographic (Age and Sex), Physiological and Exogenous factors (drug-drug interactions, for example), and Diseases and disorders such as renal failure, giving the mnemonic I GASPED. Some susceptibility factors are discrete (for example, all-or-none) and some are continuous; susceptibility can therefore be discrete or continuous; and the factors can interact to determine a person's overall susceptibility to harm.",31169324,Susceptibility to adverse drug reactions.,0,1

The presented data support the clinical impression that individuals with 22q11.2DS and comorbid psychiatric disorders are treated in a manner comparable to non-22q11.2DS individuals. However, distinct medical comorbidities common in individuals with 22q11.2DS may complicate the administration of pharmacotherapy.

"Among the congenital anomalies of the coronary arteries, absent left circumflex artery (LCX) defect is extremely rare. Only a few cases have been reported in the literature. We report a case of a 48-year-old female who presented with a 4-month history of exertional chest pain with positive stress (treadmill) test. Conventional coronary angiogram showed a normal left anterior descending, absent LCX and a super-dominant right coronary artery (RCA) with prominent branches. Aortography also failed to show a separate ostium for the left circumflex artery. Multi-detector computed tomographic coronary angiography was performed to confirm the diagnosis of congenital absence of the LCX. It is a benign incidental finding, however some patients present with angina-like symptoms often resulting in detection of this rare anatomy on coronary angiography.

"Many antiseizure medications (ASMs) affect ion channel function. We investigated whether ASMs alter the risk of cardiac events in patients with corrected QT (QT<sub>c</sub>) prolongation. The study included people from the Rochester-based Long QT syndrome (LQTS) Registry with baseline QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation and history of ASM therapy (n = 296). Using multivariate Anderson-Gill models, we assessed the risk of recurrent cardiac events associated with ASM therapy. We stratified by LQTS genotype and predominant mechanism of ASM action (Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker and gamma-aminobutyric acid modifier.) There was an increased risk of cardiac events when participants with QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation were taking vs off ASMs (HR 1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.36-2.00, P < 0.001). There was an increased risk of cardiac events when LQTS2 (HR 1.49, 95% CI 1.03-2.15, P = 0.036) but not LQTS1 participants were taking ASMs (interaction, P = 0.016). Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker ASMs were associated with an increased risk of cardiac events in participants with QT<sub>c</sub> prolongation, specifically LQTS2, but decreased risk in LQTS1. The increased risk when taking all ASMs and Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker ASMs was attenuated by concurrent beta-adrenergic blocker therapy (interaction, P < 0.001). Gamma-aminobutyric acid modifier ASMs were associated with an increased risk of events in patients not concurrently treated with beta-adrenergic blockers. Female participants were at an increased risk of cardiac events while taking all ASMs and each class of ASMs. Despite no change in overall QT<sub>c</sub> duration, pharmacogenomic analyses set the stage for future prospective clinical and mechanistic studies to validate that ASMs with predominantly Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocking actions are deleterious in LQTS2, but protective in LQTS1.",29121487,Risk of cardiac events in Long QT syndrome patients when taking antiseizure medications.,1,1

"Women planning a pregnancy and pregnant women in the first trimester are recommended to use folate-containing supplements in order to prevent neural tube defects. The prevention of many cases of neural tube defects with folic acid is evident from meta-analysis, randomized controlled trials (RCTs), observational studies in humans and experimental evidence in animals. However, folate supplementation in pregnant women or a higher maternal folate status has been shown to be protective against other adverse birth outcomes such as congenital heart defects, low birth weight, and preterm birth. Additionally, infants and children with congenital heart defects often show disorders in folate metabolism (low folate, higher homocysteine, or low vitamin B12). Maternal genotype for several folate metabolizing genes has shown associations with the risk of having a child with congenital heart defect. There is some evidence that folate supplementation could have differential effects on sub-types of congenital heart defects, but it is not clear whether the prevention time window is the same as for neural tube defects. Some studies proposed a high dose of folic acid (in mg/d) to prevent congenital heart defects in women with a high global risk (such as those with diabetes or obesity). There are currently no RCTs to support that doses of folic acid in mg range are more effective than the currently recommended 400-800 µg/d taken at least 2-3 months before conception until the end of the first trimester.",31737547,Folate supplementation for prevention of congenital heart defects and low birth weight: an update.,0,0

"We report a case of a 2 year-old boy with Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD), severe congenital aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve and an atrial septal defect. JSRD is one of a group of conditions known as 'ciliopathies', whose multi-organ involvement results from primary cilia dysfunction. To date, there have been no other reported cases of aortic stenosis and bicuspid aortic valve associated with JSRD. Cardiac screening is not currently recommended in the management guidelines for individuals suspected of having JSRD. We speculate that while the presence of congenital aortic stenosis in this child could be caused by an unrelated genetic mechanism, it could also represent a phenotypic overlap with another ciliopathy, Bardet Biedl syndrome, in which aortic stenosis is more commonly reported. We also review the range of cardiac malformations reported to be present in all human diseases known to be ciliopathies, in order to assist with the investigation and management of individuals with a suspected or proven ciliopathy.",22910529,"Severe aortic stenosis, bicuspid aortic valve and atrial septal defect in a child with Joubert Syndrome and Related Disorders (JSRD) - a case report and review of congenital heart defects reported in the human ciliopathies.",1,0
"QT prolongation was perceived as a major antiarrhythmic mechanism, but soon became a surrogate for torsades de pointes (TdP) instead. Drugs that prolong the QT interval range from having potent torsadogenic activity to no proarrhythmic action and even antiarrhythmic effects. Blockade of hERG channels is the primary cause of TdP, but blockade/activation of other channels can also be torsadogenic. TdP is primarily caused by disturbances of TRIaD, but disturbance of wavelength can also contribute to TdP (where TRIaD is triangulation, reverse use dependence, instability and dispersion, and wavelength equals conduction velocity times effective refractory period). The above proarrhythmic parameters do not only result in TdP, but can also lead to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). Note that QT prolongation (not listed as a causal factor) yields many false positives (potentially depriving patients from much needed drugs) and false negatives (potentially exposing patients to lethal arrhythmias). Thus, drug-induced QT prolongation is a bad surrogate for TdP, VT or VF; it is high time to move away from an oversimplified and erroneous surrogate.",28853038,Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes: An All-Exclusive Relationship or Time for an Amicable Separation?,1,1

"Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies in laboratory animals are conducted as part of the process of evaluating the risk of pharmaceuticals and chemicals to human reproduction and development. In these studies, comparison of data from groups dosed with the test article to a concurrent control group is considered the most relevant approach for the interpretation of adverse effects. However, differences between the concurrent control and treated groups may arise by chance alone, and in some instances may even appear to be dose-related. These limitations of the concurrent control group are of particular concern when interpreting fetal malformation data because malformations are rare events that can be better characterized when incidences in both concurrent control and treated groups are compared to a larger set of control values. Historical control data can be useful not only to understand the range of normal for a given endpoint but also to monitor the biological variability over time due to various external factors (e.g., genetic changes in a strain, changes at the breeding facility). It can also serve to track the performance of the laboratory and identify any changes in the data that may be the result of internal factors at the performing laboratory due to modification in animal diet, seasonal changes, or even the proficiency of the technicians in handling animals and recording fetal and offspring observations. This chapter will provide the reader with guidance on building a laboratory historical control database and applying it to the scientific interpretation of reproductive and developmental toxicity data. Information on sources of external historical control data will be provided and some perspective given on the utility of this data.

The prevalence of medically-recorded severe nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy in cases with congenital abnormalities and their available matched population controls without any defect was compared in the population-based large data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance System of congenital abnormalities, 1980-1996. Of 22,843 cases with as 25 different congenital abnormality groups, 1,713 (7.5%) cases had mothers with medically recorded and treated severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy. Of 38,151 matched population controls, 3,777 (9.9%) had mothers with severe nausea and vomiting (adjusted prevalence odds ratio (POR) with 95% CI: 0.74, 0.68-0.79).

"Gulf War Illness (GWI) is a chronic multisymptom illness characterized by fatigue, musculoskeletal pain, and gastrointestinal and cognitive dysfunction believed to stem from chemical exposures during the 1990⁻1991 Persian Gulf War. There are currently no treatments; however, previous studies have predicted a putative multi-intervention treatment composed of inhibiting Th1 immune cytokines followed by inhibition of the glucocorticoid receptor (GCR) to treat GWI. These predictions suggest the use of specific monoclonal antibodies or suramin to target interleukin-2 and tumor necrosis factor α , followed by mifepristone to inhibit the GCR. In addition to this putative treatment strategy, there exist a variety of medications that target GWI symptomatology. As pharmaceuticals are promiscuous molecules, binding to multiple sites beyond their intended targets, leading to off-target interactions, it is key to ensure that none of these medications interfere with the proposed treatment avenue. Here, we used the drug docking programs AutoDock 4.2, AutoDock Vina, and Schrödinger's Glide to assess the potential off-target immune and hormone interactions of 43 FDA-approved drugs commonly used to treat GWI symptoms in order to determine their putative polypharmacology and minimize adverse drug effects in a combined pharmaceutical treatment.

"Congenital limb deficiency defects (LDDs) are etiologically heterogeneous. Acquired causes include amniotic bands, teratogens exposure, and chorionic villus sampling before 10 weeks' gestation and intrinsic causes include single-gene disorders and chromosome abnormalities. However, a substantial number of cases, especially terminal transverse deficiency defects, occur without an obvious cause and are ascribed to vascular disruption events. Some studies have found an association between maternal thrombophilia and congenital LDDs. We investigated this association through a review of all prenatally identified LDDs at a major tertiary care center in Toronto, Canada over a 12-year period. Our results showed a higher prevalence of thrombophilias among women with a pregnancy affected with an LDD when compared to the general population [χ<sup>2</sup> (3) = 54.63, P < 0.01]. Our research was strengthened by the inclusion of affected pregnancies regardless of outcome, and strict criteria to avoid including LDDs with a non-vascular etiology. Most LDDs were identified during the routine 18-20 week anatomy ultrasound, but some were discovered as early as 13 weeks' gestation. We found an excess of left-sided defects among terminal transverse but not longitudinal deficiencies; additionally, all diagnoses of maternal thrombophilia occurred in the terminal transverse group. Our results support thrombophilia screening in all women with a prenatally diagnosed fetal LDD as well as careful evaluation of the fetal extremities during prenatal ultrasounds in women with a known thrombophilia. © 2016 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",27530094,Congenital limb deficiencies with vascular etiology: Possible association with maternal thrombophilia.,1,0

"The potencies of resorcinol, 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) and methimazole (MMI) for inducing developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity were compared in pregnant rats, regarded as valid model for human thyroid toxicity. Profound differences on maternal thyroid hormone levels (THs), maternal toxicity as well as developmental and neurotoxicity sequelae occurred. Resorcinol affected none of those end points. PTU and MMI caused significant effects. Therapy with either PTU or MMI during the first trimester of human pregnancy can cause reductions of maternal THs, accompanied by disruptions of prenatal development. Clinical MMI studies show sporadic evidence of teratogenic effects, with equivocal relation to thyroid peroxidase (TPO) inhibition. In recent decades no MMI associated prenatal toxicity has been reported, an outcome possibly related to carefully managed therapy. Orally administered resorcinol was rapidly absorbed, metabolized and excreted and was undetectable in the thyroid. In contrast, PTU or MMI accumulated. Resorcinol's potency to inhibit TPO was profoundly lower than that of PTU or MMI. Quantum chemical calculations may explain low resorcinol reactivity with TPO. Thus, distinctions in the target organ and the TPO inhibitory potency between these chemicals are likely contributing to different reductions of maternal THs levels and affecting the potency to cause developmental toxicity and neurotoxicity.

"Background In line with the changing role of community pharmacists, we describe here a standardised procedure for detecting DRPs in elderly patients for use in community pharmacies. Objectives The primary aim was to describe the number and type of DRPs identified by community pharmacists in elderly patients. Secondary aims were to determine the number and type of associated pharmacist interventions (PIs) that were transmitted to the prescribers, and to identify risk factors associated with the occurrence of a PI. Setting Community pharmacies. Methods In this prospective, multicentre study, pharmacists received patients aged 65 and over. During a 30-min interview with patients who agreed to participate, patient characteristics were recorded such as age, weight, height, frailty (using the Short Emergency Geriatric Assessment grid), estimated renal function and compliance with treatment assessed by the Girerd scale. Main outcome measure DRPs characteristics. Results A total of 892 patients agreed to participate in 55 pharmacies. Among them 334 DRPs were identified and were associated with 259 PIs. Eighty-nine PIs of 259 were sent to the prescribing physicians; 70 (78%) were implemented by the general practitioner. Factors associated with the occurrence of a DRP are compliance problems [odds ratio (OR) = 1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.26-2.58)], frailty [OR = 1.3, 95% CI (1.01-1.66)], number of prescribed drugs per day [OR = 1.46, 95% CI (1.02-2.07)] and GFR < 60 mL/min [OR = 1.49, 95% CI (1.01-2.2)]. Conclusion This is the first standardised pharmaceutical assessment dedicated to the elderly carried out by community pharmacists in France.

The proposal was based on the results of a survey conducted in 2014, where 20 facilities (including pharmaceutical, chemical, and pesticide companies and contract laboratories) and 2 selected expert teratologists in Japan were asked for their opinions on the categorization of these findings. Based on the discussion, Japanese Teratology Society members have agreed that 42 out of the 73 findings can be classified as Malformations (38), Non-structural abnormalities (3), Malformations/Non-structural abnormalities (1), and Variations (0), while the remaining 31 findings were recommended to be categorized as Not applicable for fetuses. The details of the classification are shown on the website of the Japanese Teratology Society (http://www.umin.ac.jp/cadb/External.pdf).",29381232,Categorization of fetal external findings in developmental toxicology studies by the Terminology Committee of the Japanese Teratology Society.,1,0

"Background Small for gestational age (SGA) birth is associated with poor long-term health outcomes. It is unclear whether maternal antihypertensive medication increases risk of SGA independently of maternal hypertension. Methods We analyzed associations between maternal hypertension and antihypertensive medication use and SGA among non-malformed singleton controls in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study. We defined SGA as birthweight < 10th percentile for a given gestational age, sex, race/ethnicity, and parity. We included 1045 SGA and 10,019 non-SGA births. We used logistic regression to calculate adjusted odds ratios (AORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed interaction between hypertension, antihypertensive use, and maternal race/ethnicity and age. Results Overall, 122 (11.7%) SGA and 892 (8.9%) non-SGA mothers reported hypertension and 21 (2.0%) SGA and 154 (1.5%) non-SGA mothers reported antihypertensive use. The most commonly reported medications were centrally-acting antiadrenergics, β-blockers, calcium channel blockers, and diuretics. Compared to normotensive pregnancies, maternal hypertension, regardless of treatment (AOR, 1.49 [95% CI, 1.20, 1.86]), and untreated maternal hypertension [AOR, 1.46 (95% CI, 1.15, 1.86)] were associated with SGA. We observed a positive, but not significant, association between antihypertensive use and SGA. SGA risk varied by maternal race/ethnicity, being highest among Hispanic mothers, and age, being highest among mothers ≥ 35 years, but statistical tests for interaction were not significant. Conclusions Consistent with the literature, our findings suggest that maternal hypertension slightly increases SGA risk. We did not observe an appreciably increased SGA risk associated with antihypertensive medication use beyond that of the underlying maternal hypertension.",29124624,"Maternal Hypertension, Antihypertensive Medication Use, and Small for Gestational Age Births in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997-2011.",0,0

"The European Commission through its Directorates-General Joint Research Centre (DG JRC) and Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE) is developing the European Platform on Rare Diseases Registration (EU RD Platform) with the objective to set European-level standards for data collection and data sharing. In the field of rare diseases the EU RD Platform will be a source of information on available rare disease patient data with large transnational European coverage. One main function of the EU RD Platform is to enable interoperability for the >600 existing RD registries in Europe. The second function is to offer a sustainable solution for two large European surveillance networks: European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROCAT) and Surveillance of Cerebral Palsy in Europe (SCPE). EUROCAT is European network of population-based registries for the epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies. It covers about one third of the European birth population. The Central Database contains about 800,000 cases with congenital anomalies among livebirths, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy, reported using the same standardised classification and coding. These high quality data enables epidemiological surveillance of congenital anomalies, which includes estimating prevalence, prenatal diagnosis and perinatal mortality rates and the detection of teratogenic exposures among others. The network also develops recommendations for primary prevention in the Rare Diseases National Plans for medicinal drugs, food/nutrition, lifestyle, health services, and environmental pollution. The network has received the European Commission's support since its inception. In order to offer a sustainable solution for the continuation of EUROCAT activities, it was agreed that EUROCAT would become part of the EU RD Platform. In 2015, the European level-coordination activities and the Central Database were transferred to the DG JRC, where the JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry is now located. This paper describes the functioning of EUROCAT in the new setting, and gives an overview of the activities and the organisation of the JRC-EUROCAT Central Registry.",29597096,A sustainable solution for the activities of the European network for surveillance of congenital anomalies: EUROCAT as part of the EU Platform on Rare Diseases Registration.,1,0
"The incidence and impacts of adverse drug events (ADE) have been extensively studied, but there is an emerging focus on real-time detection systems. These can play an important role, along with systems pharmacology and population-level epidemiology, in a multipronged approach to prevent ADEs and mitigate their harm. Tailoring ADE detection systems to a particular health care setting or ADE type can improve predictive accuracy, but the added complexity reduces its wider applicability. As this approach becomes increasingly used we can imagine detection algorithms of greater complexity but also a set of algorithms encompassing the full range of health care settings and ADE types, thus creating a system that is both accurate and widely applicable.",30595045,Detecting Adverse Drug Events: Accuracy and Generalizability.,0,1

"The effect of medication is always a balance between their beneficial effects and any adverse reactions they might elicit. The main risk for adverse drug events {ADEs) is polypharmacy, which is the simultaneous use of multiple drugs.This often applies to older patients, who suffer from multiple diseases and therefore take multiple medications. Thus, itis not surprising, that ADEs are frequention older patients and account up to 16% of emergency visits. It is still under discussion, whether age is an independent risk factor for ADEs. However, there are some age-related changes in the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties of many drugs, which may influence the highly fragile balance between benefit and harm in older patients. Though there are multiple risk factors for and causes of ADEs, it could be shown that a lot of ADEs are preventable and even predictable: Budnitz eta/. showed that almost two thirds of emergency hospitalisations occur due to four medication classes: warfarin, oral antiplatelet agents, insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents. Nevertheless, only 40-60% ofA DEs are recognized in the emergency department. This might be explained by the broad clinical symptoms, ranging from bleeding due to anticoagulants to the more nonspecific symptom of weakness due to hyponatraemia secondary to thiazide diuretics. Detecting and avoiding ADEs could be aided by using lists such as Beers criteria or STOPP/FART which list medications which are potentially inappropriate for older patients.",26654810,[Adverse drug events of older patients presenting in the emergency department].,0,1

"Congenital scoliosis (CS) is a form of scoliosis caused by congenital vertebral malformations. Genetic predisposition has been demonstrated in CS. We previously reported that TBX6 loss-of-function causes CS in a compound heterozygous model; however, this model can explain only 10% of CS. Many monogenic and polygenic CS genes remain to be elucidated. In this study, we analyzed exome sequencing (ES) data of 615 Chinese CS from the Deciphering Disorders Involving Scoliosis and COmorbidities (DISCO) project. Cosegregation studies for 103 familial CS identified a novel heterozygous nonsense variant, c.2649G>A (p.Trp883Ter) in FBN1. The association between FBN1 and CS was then analyzed by extracting FBN1 variants from ES data of 574 sporadic CS and 828 controls; 30 novel variants were identified and prioritized for further analyses. A mutational burden test showed that the deleterious FBN1 variants were significantly enriched in CS subjects (OR = 3.9, P = 0.03 by Fisher's exact test). One missense variant, c.2613A>C (p.Leu871Phe) was recurrent in two unrelated CS subjects, and in vitro functional experiments for the variant suggest that FBN1 may contribute to CS by upregulating the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) signaling.

"Primary congenital glaucoma (PCG) and anterior segment defects (ASDs) are rare ocular malformations diagnosed early in life which can cause blindness. Pathogenic variants in several genes have been linked to these conditions, but little is known about nongenetic risk factors. We investigated the association between maternal nutrition and PCG and ASDs in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study, a large population-based, multicenter case-control study of major birth defects in the United States. Mothers of cases (n = 152) and control infants without a birth defect (n = 9,178) completed an interview which included a food frequency questionnaire capturing usual dietary intake in the year before pregnancy. Maternal nutrition was assessed through individual nutrient intake, calculating a Diet Quality Index for Pregnancy (DQI-P) score for each mother, and using latent class analysis to empirically derive four dietary patterns. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using logistic regression. The results for individual nutrients varied, with some having an inverse or U-shaped pattern of association with increasing intake. The DQI-P was not associated with risk of PCG and ASDs (aOR 0.91; CI 0.49-1.66, highest vs. lowest quartile). The dietary pattern analysis suggested lower odds among women with a Prudent and Mexican dietary pattern (aOR 0.82, 95% CI 0.52-1.29; aOR 0.80, 95% CI 0.36-1.78, respectively) compared to those with a Western dietary pattern. We found that higher intake of some nutrients and certain dietary patterns may be inversely associated with PCG and ASDs, though caution is urged due to imprecision of estimates.",32154673,Maternal diet as a risk factor for primary congenital glaucoma and defects of the anterior segment of the eye in the National Birth Defects Prevention Study.,0,0

"There have been no large, nationwide, birth cohort studies in Japan examining the effects of house renovation during pregnancy on congenital abnormality. This study examined the impact of (1) prenatal exposure to house renovation and (2) maternal occupational exposure to organic solvents and/or formaldehyde on the incidence of congenital abnormality. The fixed data of 67,503 singleton births from a large national birth cohort study that commenced in 2011 were used to evaluate the presence of congenital abnormalities and potential confounding factors. We employed multiple logistic regression analysis to search for correlations between maternal exposure to house renovation or organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy and such congenital abnormalities as congenital heart disease, cleft lip and/or palate, male genital abnormality, limb defect, and gastrointestinal obstruction. After controlling for potential confounding factors, we observed that house renovation was significantly associated with male genital abnormality (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.03-3.17, P = 0.04) when stratified by congenital abnormality, with no other remarkable relations to house renovation or occupational use of organic solvents and/or formaldehyde during pregnancy. There were also significant correlations for maternal BMI before pregnancy, history of ovulation induction through medication, maternal diabetes mellitus/gestational diabetes mellitus, and hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with an increased risk of congenital abnormality.

"1. Present attitudes to drug safety have been shaped largely by a series of disasters. 2. In 1937 about 107 people in the USA died of poisoning by diethylene glycol used as a vehicle for sulphanilamide which led to the requirement that all formulations must be licensed by the FDA before marketing. 3. Up to 1960 the rate of production of new drugs outstripped the ability to introduce them safely. In Germany, thalidomide, an effective sedative, had been introduced in 1956 but it was not until 1961, when an estimated 10,000 babies worldwide had been born with birth deformities, that the teratogenicity of this compound was recognized. 4. Further legislation soon followed, both reducing the number and lengthening the time required to introduce a new drug onto the market. However, problems were encountered with practolol in the 1970s and with benoxaprofen in the 1980s, the latter highlighting the need to make special provision for drug use in the elderly. 5.

"Congenital heart defects (CHD) are the most prevalent anomaly both clinically and in laboratory animal species. Historically, it was difficult to assess the longitudinal progression or repair of such anomalies because assessment methodologies were too invasive (gross exams and/or histology). Recently, technological advances in the field of diagnostic imaging have led to the manufacture of high-resolution ultrasound (HRUS), capable of characterizing both embryonic and maternal cardiovascular structure and function in small animals (rat and mouse). HRUS is relatively noninvasive, facilitating the longitudinal assessment of heart development throughout gestation and postnatally, providing a comprehensive evaluation of changes in cardiovascular performance following toxicant exposure.Described herein is a brief overview of important theoretical and practical considerations when applying HRUS to understand the impact of perturbations on the fetal heart. Examples are given from our own work to help the reader interpret their own HRUS images and more readily identify anomalies in utero. In addition to embryonic assessment, maternal pathologies may adversely affect the cardiovascular performance of the conceptus indirectly. Umbilical blood flow is particularly vulnerable to such effects and procedures to assess this endpoint are described. Neonatal rats, born with CHD, may respond pathologically to cardiovascular challenges as they mature, and we outline the use of HRUS to evaluate cardiac performance over the lifetime of the animal.

"This report discusses the principles of reproductive toxicity risk assessment for biopharmaceuticals blocking the PD-1/programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway, which have been developed for the treatment of patients with advanced malignancies. The PD-1/PD-L1 pathway is a T-cell co-inhibitory pathway that normally maintains immune tolerance to self. Its role in pregnancy is to maintain immune tolerance to the fetal allograft. In cancer patients, this signaling pathway is hijacked by some neoplasms to avoid immune destruction. PD-1/PD-L1-blocking agents enhance functional activity of the target lymphocytes to eventually cause immune rejection of the tumor. A therapeutic blockade of PD-1/PD-L1 pathway that occurs at full target engagement provides a unique challenge to address the risk to pregnancy because disruption of the same pathway may also reduce or abrogate maternal immune tolerance to the fetal alloantigens inherited through the father. Typically, nonclinical reproductive and developmental toxicity (DART) studies in animals (rats and rabbits) with clinical drug candidates are conducted to identify potential risk in humans and to determine exposure margin for the effects on reproduction as part of the risk assessment. However, for biopharmaceuticals for which the desired mechanism of action cannot be separated from potential deleterious effects to the fetus and when the only relevant toxicology species is nonhuman primate (NHP), the risk to reproduction can be predicted by a mechanism-based assessment using data generated from murine surrogate models as supportive information without conducting DART in NHPs. Such an approach has been used in the evaluation of pregnancy risk of anti-PD-1 agent, pembrolizumab, and has been demonstrated as an important alternative to performing DART studies in NHPs.

"<b>Objective:</b> To analyze the clinical characteristics and appropriate surgical procedures, and discuss the classification of congenital middle ear malformation. <b>Methods:</b> All cases were from the Center of Otorhinolaryngology, the Sixth Medical Center of Department of PLA General Hospital. All of these cases, including 26 male patients (ears) , 10 female patients (11 ears) , aged from 7 to 57 years old, had normal external auditory canal, tympanic membrane, conductive hearing loss, type A tympanogram and negative Gelle's test. Tympanoplasty was performed in all cases. The deformity was classified to three types,i.e., Type I (stapes foot plate mobility): Ⅰa, ossicular chain deformity with normal stapes suprastructure; Ⅰb, ossicular chain deformity with abnormal stapes suprastructure; Type Ⅱ (stapes foot plate fixation): Ⅱ a,normal ossicular chain, Ⅱ b, ossicular chain malformation; and Type Ⅲ: vestibular window osseous atresia or undeveloped, or with round window atresia. The malformation of type Ⅱ and Ⅲ may be accompanied with abnormal facial nerve. In addition, the papers on middle ear malformation published from 1982 to 2017 were analyzed retrospectively. The clinical data of 451 ears malformation were summarized. <b>Results:</b> According to the revisional classification criteria in 37 ear samples from our hospital, 20 ears were type I. 6 type Ⅰa cases were used PORP (partial ossicular replacement prosthesis) to reconstruct the ossicular chain; 14 type Ⅰb cases were used TORP (total ossicular replacement prosthesis) to reconstruct the ossicular chain. For the 5 ears of type Ⅱ, 2 of which were type Ⅱ a and 3 were type Ⅱ b. 4 ear samples of type Ⅱ were implanted with Piston ossicular prosthesis, 1 was implanted with TORP in which the ossificated foot plate was removed with periosteum preserved. 12 ear samples were type Ⅲ, with vestibular window osseous atresia, facial nerve malformation, and stapes suprastructure malformation. The pistons ossicular prosthesis were implanted in vestibular window in 3 ears with facial nerve covering vestibular window partially. The surgery had to be given up in 5 ears, and TORP was implanted in 4 ears at the opening with preserved periosteum at the beginning of the tympanic scala because of facial nerve covering vestibular window totally. 30 ears with complete follow-up data had no sensorineural hearing loss and the average air-bone conduction decreased 23.3±10.7 dB (<i>P</i><0.05).There were 234 ears of type Ⅰ in 451 ears of congenital middle ear malformation reported in the literature. 113 of which were type Ⅰa, the basic surgery was ossicular chain shaking and artificial or autogenous PORP implantation. Type Ⅰb was 121 ears, with autogenous or artificial TORP and PORP. Type Ⅱ was125 ears, including type Ⅱa 22 ears, Ⅱb 60 ears, and no subclassification for 43 ears.

"Cardiotoxicity by doxorubicin hampers its therapeutic potential as an anticancer drug, but mechanisms leading to cardiotoxicity remain contentious. Through this study, the functional contribution of insulin-like growth factor receptor type II α (IGF-IIRα) which is a novel stress-inducible protein was explored in doxorubicin-induced cardiac stress. Employing both in vitro H9c2 cells and in vivo transgenic rat models (SD-TG [IGF-IIRα]) overexpressing IGF-IIRα specifically in heart, we found that IGF-IIRα leads to cardiac structural abnormalities and functional perturbations that were severely aggravated by doxorubicin-induced cardiac stress. Overexpression of IGF-IIRα leads to cumulative elevation of stress associated cardiac hypertrophy and apoptosis factors. There was a significant reduction of survival associated proteins p-Akt and estrogen receptor β/α, and abnormal elevation of cardiac hypertrophy markers such as atrial natriuretic peptide, cardiac troponin-I, and apoptosis-inducing agents such as p53, Bax, and cytochrome C, respectively. IGF-IIRα also altered the expressions of AT1R, ERK1/2, and p38 proteins. Besides, IGF-IIRα also increased the reactive oxygen species production in H9c2 cells which were markedly aggravated by doxorubicin treatment. Together, we showed that IGF-IIRα is a novel stress-induced protein that perturbed cardiac homeostasis and cumulatively exacerbated the doxorubicin-induced cardiac injury that perturbed heart functions and ensuing cardiomyopathy.",31104312,Upregulation of IGF-IIRα intensifies doxorubicin-induced cardiac damage.,1,1
"The application of immunological checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has modified many treatment strategies of malignant tumors, which has become a milestone in cancer therapy. The principle of action can be explained as ""brake theory"". After releasing the brakes by ICIs, unprecedented systemic toxicities, even some refractory and fatal immune-related adverse effects (irAEs) may develop. In this article, we summarized the recommended treatments of grade 3-4 severe irAEs in the latest European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO), National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer (SITC) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) guidelines and consensus. We also performed a systemic review of case reports and reviews of irAEs up to May 20, 2019 in PubMed and Chinese journals. Successful applications of specific immunosuppressive drugs and stimulating factors beyond the above guidelines and consensus were supplemented and highlighted, including agents blocking interleukin 6 (IL-6), rituximab, anti-tumor necrosis factor-α (TNFα) monoclonal antibody (mAb), anti-integrin 4 mAb, Janus kinase inhibitors, thrombopoietin receptor agonists and antithymocyte globulin (ATG) etc. We put some concerns of using high-dose steroids for long-term, and emphasize the secondary infections, tumor progression, and unavailability of ICI re-challenge during steroid treatment. We propose the ""De-escalation Therapy"" principle for severe and refractory irAEs, and suggest that immunosuppressive drugs specifically targeting cytokines should be used as early as possible. Many irAEs in the era of immunotherapy are unprecedented compared with traditional chemotherapy and small-molecule targeted therapy, which is a big challenge to oncologists.

"Congenital defects of adrenal steroidogenesis comprises a group of autosomally recessive disorders, which are usually caused by inactivating mutations in single enzymes involved in adrenal steroid biosynthesis. Each of the defects causes different biochemical consequences and clinical features. A different degree of enzyme dysfunction is responsible for a wide range of phenotypic expression even in the same disorder. The basis for the diagnosis of inborn errors of steroidogenesis are often refined methods for steroid determination. Because these defects may result in life-threatening conditions and, if not treated, lead to serious complications, its is essential to consider their presence in a differential diagnosis of various symptoms. Deficiency of 21-hydroxylase, the most common of these disorders, has been recently extensively reviewed. Therefore, this paper discusses the etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestation, biochemical abnormalities and management of other less frequent defects of adrenal steroidogenesis.",18777507,[Rare congenital defects of adrenal steroidogenesis].,0,0

A 6-week trial of eltrombopag (an agonist of the Tpo receptor) failed to increase the platelet count.

"At the Rotterdam Fetal Medicine Unit over a period of 20 years, scanning for foetal anomalies has been performed in more than 24,000 pregnancies at risk of a foetal congenital anomaly. In pregnancies where there was prior knowledge of increased risk of a foetal anomaly (group I), the incidence of foetal pathology was 2-5%. In pregnancies in which a foetal anomaly was suspected on clinical or sonographic grounds (group II), the incidence of foetal pathology was 32-57%. For reasons of good-image quality, group I pregnancies were nearly always referred for a foetal-anomaly scan at 18-21 weeks of gestation. Group II pregnancies were often referred after 24 weeks of gestation, which is the upper legal limit for termination of pregnancy in the Netherlands. The detection rate was 94.7% (2000 and 2001).

CHD was diagnosed in 195 fetuses. The top 5 types of CHD were, in order, single ventricle (15.9%, 31/195), atrioventricular septal defect (12.3%, 24/195), ventricular septal defect (VSD) (11.8%, 23/195), tetralogy of Fallot (10.8%, 21/195), and double-outlet right ventricle (8.2%, 16/195). The 195 cases of CHD comprised 316 defects in total. The most common defect was ventricular malformation (40.5%, 128/316), followed by great artery anomalies (38.0%, 120/316), endocardial cushion abnormalities (11.7%, 37/316), atrial abnormalities (6.6%, 21/316), and semilunar valve abnormalities (3.2%, 10/316). VSD accounted for the largest proportion (24.4%, 77/316) of the ventricular malformations.

"""Torsade de pointes"" (TdP) is a clinico-electrocardiographic syndrome characterized by an abnormally prolonged QT interval and the occurrence of potentially life-threatening ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Two mayor causes can be distinguished: congenital and acquired long QT syndrome. Whereas the former has recently been identified as an ion channelopathy, the mechanisms underlying acquired long QT syndrome are far from being understood. It has been suggested that patients with the acquired form of the disease may suffer from a clinically hidden form of the congenital variant. However, recent studies have yielded only a small number of individual cases in whom genetic analyses revealed the presence of an ion channel gene mutation. Since acquired long QT syndrome is most often induced by drugs prolonging myocardial repolarization, it is largely an iatrogenic disease. In order to prevent unwitting exposure to risk, physicians prescribing agents that may prolong repolarization need to be aware of the typical clinico-electrocardiographic characteristics of drug-induced TdP, and its diagnosis and management. A clearer delineation of the risk factors predisposing to abnormal prolongation of repolarization, and a more precise quantification of the torsadogenic potency of individual drugs appear mandatory in order to prevent or at least minimize the occurrence of this potentially fatal adverse effect of certain drugs.",12090902,Physician-induced torsade de pointes--therapeutic implications.,1,1

"Some drugs have been reported to induce severe ventricular arrhythmias, including torsades de pointes, and have been responsible in some cases for sudden death of patients. Although the mechanisms of these arrhythmias are not well understood, they are often, but not always, associated with QT interval prolongation. Regulatory authorities (CPMP in Europe) have recently pointed out the necessity to assess most carefully the potential, especially of non-cardiovascular drugs, for QT interval prolongation. Different methodological approaches are presented in this paper and experimental protocols are suggested; limitations and advantages of the presently available in vitro and in vivo models are discussed. It appears that both in vitro and in vivo approaches are complementary. In particular it is pointed out that only the in vitro models using isolated cardiac tissues (Purkinje fibres or papillary muscles) enable assessment of the drug properties under low cardiac rhythm conditions. This model allows us to mimic pathological situations of long QT interval (such as acquired or congenital long QT syndrome) in which most of the major clinical problems are encountered.

"We aimed to assess the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities among infants with congenital heart defects (CHDs) in an analysis of population-based surveillance data. We reviewed data from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, a population-based birth-defects surveillance system, to assess the frequency of chromosomal abnormalities among live-born infants and fetal deaths with CHDs delivered from January 1, 1994, to December 31, 2005. Among 4430 infants with CHDs, 547 (12.3%) had a chromosomal abnormality. CHDs most likely to be associated with a chromosomal abnormality were interrupted aortic arch (type B and not otherwise specified; 69.2%), atrioventricular septal defect (67.2%), and double-outlet right ventricle (33.3%). The most common chromosomal abnormalities observed were trisomy 21 (52.8%), trisomy 18 (12.8%), 22q11.2 deletion (12.2%), and trisomy 13 (5.7%). In conclusion, in our study, approximately 1 in 8 infants with a CHD had a chromosomal abnormality. Clinicians should have a low threshold at which to obtain testing for chromosomal abnormalities in infants with CHDs, especially those with certain types of CHDs.

"<b>Background.</b> The Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak in the Americas has caused international concern due to neurological sequelae linked to the infection, such as microcephaly and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS). The World Health Organization stated that there is ""sufficient evidence to conclude that Zika virus is a cause of congenital abnormalities and is a trigger of GBS"". This conclusion was based on a systematic review of the evidence published until 30.05.2016. Since then, the body of evidence has grown substantially, leading to this update of that systematic review with new evidence published from 30.05.2016 - 18.01.2017, update 1. <b>Methods.</b> We review evidence on the causal link between ZIKV infection and adverse congenital outcomes and the causal link between ZIKV infection and GBS or immune-mediated thrombocytopaenia purpura. We also describe the transition of the review into a living systematic review, a review that is continually updated. <b>Results.</b> Between 30.05.2016 and 18.01.2017, we identified 2413 publications, of which 101 publications were included. The evidence added in this update confirms the conclusion of a causal association between ZIKV and adverse congenital outcomes. New findings expand the evidence base in the dimensions of biological plausibility, strength of association, animal experiments and specificity. For GBS, the body of evidence has grown during the search period for update 1, but only for dimensions that were already populated in the previous version. There is still a limited understanding of the biological pathways that potentially cause the occurrence of autoimmune disease following ZIKV infection. <b>Conclusions.</b> This systematic review confirms previous conclusions that ZIKV is a cause of congenital abnormalities, including microcephaly, and is a trigger of GBS. The transition to living systematic review techniques and methodology provides a proof of concept for the use of these methods to synthesise evidence about an emerging pathogen such as ZIKV.",30631437,Zika virus infection as a cause of congenital brain abnormalities and Guillain-Barré syndrome: From systematic review to living systematic review.,1,0
"Cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors are ubiquitous in aquatic systems and have been detected in fish tissues. The exposure of fish to these pharmaceuticals is concerning because COX inhibitors disrupt the synthesis of prostaglandins (PGs), which modulate a variety of essential biological functions, including reproduction. In this study, we investigated the effects of well-characterized mammalian COX inhibitors on female fathead minnow reproductive health. Fish (n = 8) were exposed for 96 h to water containing indomethacin (IN; 100 µg/l), ibuprofen (IB; 200 µg/l) or celecoxib (CX; 20 µg/l), and evaluated for effects on liver metabolome and ovarian gene expression. Metabolomic profiles of IN, IB and CX were not significantly different from control or one another. Exposure to IB and CX resulted in differential expression of comparable numbers of genes (IB = 433, CX = 545). In contrast, 2558 genes were differentially expressed in IN-treated fish. Functional analyses (canonical pathway and gene set enrichment) indicated extensive effects of IN on PG synthesis pathway, oocyte meiosis, and several other processes consistent with physiological roles of PGs. Transcriptomic data were congruent with PG data; IN-reduced plasma PG F2α concentration, whereas IB and CX did not. Five putative AOPs were developed linking the assumed molecular initiating event of COX inhibition, with PG reduction and the adverse outcome of reproductive failure via reduction of: (1) ovulation, (2) reproductive behaviors mediated by exogenous or endogenous PGs, and (3) oocyte maturation in fish. These pathways were developed using, in part, empirical data from the present study and other publicly available data.",28201806,Derivation and Evaluation of Putative Adverse Outcome Pathways for the Effects of Cyclooxygenase Inhibitors on Reproductive Processes in Female Fish.,0,1

"Evidence suggests that exposure to elevated concentrations of air pollution during pregnancy is associated with increased risks of birth defects and other adverse birth outcomes. While current regulations put limits on total PM2.5 concentrations, there are many speciated pollutants within this size class that likely have distinct effects on perinatal health. However, due to correlations between these speciated pollutants, it can be difficult to decipher their effects in a model for birth outcomes. To combat this difficulty, we develop a multivariate spatio-temporal Bayesian model for speciated particulate matter using dynamic spatial factors. These spatial factors can then be interpolated to the pregnant women's homes to be used to model birth defects. The birth defect model allows the impact of pollutants to vary across different weeks of the pregnancy in order to identify susceptible periods.

"To evaluate the accuracy of computerized algorithms for pinpointing periods of exposure to medications during pregnancy in the absence of data on timing of conception, the authors used data from a population-based sample of nonmalformed infants in the Slone Epidemiology Center Birth Defects Study in 1998-2006 (United States and Canada; N = 3,177). The standard was defined as any antiinfective use from 2 weeks after the last menstrual period through the third gestational month, which was compared with results obtained after defining the beginning of pregnancy as either 270 days before the birth date (delivery-date algorithm) or the date of the first prenatal visit (pregnancy-indicator algorithm). The sensitivity was 92% (95% confidence interval: 88, 95) for the delivery-date algorithm and 59% (95% confidence interval: 53, 65) for the pregnancy-indicator algorithm. The specificity was higher than 98% for both algorithms. The sensitivity for the delivery-date algorithm among women with preterm births was 66% (95% confidence interval: 49, 80). For women without pregnancy complications, subtraction of 270 days from the delivery date might be accurate for timing first-trimester prescription drug use in automated databases. However, the sensitivity of this algorithm is lower for preterm deliveries, suggesting limited validity to assess drug safety for pregnancy outcomes associated with prematurity.",18194999,Sensitivity and specificity of computerized algorithms to classify gestational periods in the absence of information on date of conception.,1,1

"Central precocious puberty (CPP) is defined as an early pubertal development that occurs before the age of 9 years in boys and 8 years in girls. It results from premature activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRHa) have been the gold standard therapy for CPP for more than 30 years. These compounds have a high affinity for the pituitary LHRH receptor and are resistant to enzymatic degradation. Through continuous stimulation, GnRHa inhibit the pulsatile secretion of gonadotropin, resulting in hormonal suppression, cessation of pubertal development, and normalization of growth and skeletal maturation rates. The goal of therapy is to halt pubertal progression and delay epiphyseal maturation that leads to improvement of final adult height. There are no widely accepted guidelines for how long to continue treatment with a GnRHa for CPP, and individual practice varies widely. Furthermore, conflicting results have been published on the long-term effects of GnRHa therapy in patients with CPP. Therefore, we reviewed the current literature focusing our attention on the long-term effects and the significant adverse drug reactions (ADRs) observed during treatment with GnRHa in patients with CPP. Our review may provide the necessary data to enable clinicians to administer GnRHa in the safest and most appropriate way.

"The study aimed to verify the application and performance of triggers for adverse drug events in hospitalized newborns. This prospective cohort study was conducted in the neonatal care units of a university hospital from March to September 2015. A list of triggers was developed for the identification of adverse drug events in this population. The list included antidote, clinical, and laboratory triggers. A total of 125 newborns who had received drugs during the hospitalization were included. Neonatal patient charts were screened to detect triggers. When a trigger was found, the patient chart was reviewed to identify possible adverse drug events. Each trigger's yield in the identification of adverse drug events was calculated and then classified according to its performance. Nine hundred and twenty-five triggers identified 208 suspected adverse drug events. The triggers' overall yield was 22.5%. The most frequently identified triggers were: drop in oxygen saturation, increased frequency of bowel movements, medications stop, and vomiting. The triggers with the best performance in the identification of adverse drug events were: increased creatinine, increased urea, necrotizing enterocolitis, prescription of flumazenil, hypercalcemia, hyperkalemia, hypernatremia, and oversedation.

Pediatric populations are especially vulnerable to ADRs due to the lack of data for this age group from the drug development process and because of the wide use of off-label and unlicensed use of drugs. Children are more prone to specific types of ADRs because of the level of maturity of body systems involved in absorption, metabolism, transportation, and elimination of drugs.

"Spontaneous adverse event reports have a high potential for detecting adverse drug reactions. However, due to their dimension, the analysis of such databases requires statistical methods. In this context, disproportionality measures can be used. Their main idea is to project the data onto contingency tables in order to measure the strength of associations between drugs and adverse events. However, due to the data projection, these methods are sensitive to the problem of coprescriptions and masking effects. Recently, logistic regressions have been used with a Lasso type penalty to perform the detection of associations between drugs and adverse events. On different examples, this approach limits the drawbacks of the disproportionality methods, but the choice of the penalty value is open to criticism while it strongly influences the results. In this paper, we propose to use a logistic regression whose sparsity is viewed as a model selection challenge. Since the model space is huge, a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm carries out the model selection by maximizing the BIC criterion. Thus, we avoid the calibration of penalty or threshold. During our application on the French pharmacovigilance database, the proposed method is compared to well-established approaches on a reference dataset, and obtains better rates of positive and negative controls. However, many signals (i.e., specific drug-event associations) are not detected by the proposed method. So, we conclude that this method should be used in parallel to existing measures in pharmacovigilance.

"Telbivudine, an FDA pregnancy category B drug, has been found to reduce hepatitis B virus (HBV) perinatal transmission with no safety concerns in infants aged up to 1 year. This study evaluated the long-term efficacy and safety of telbivudine in 214 infants born to 210 pregnant women with chronic hepatitis B infection who were treated with telbivudine during pregnancy (weeks 20-32 of gestation). The infants were followed for up to 5 years after birth. The efficacy endpoint was the rate of perinatal transmission, which was established by HBsAg and HBV DNA levels at 7 and 12 months. Safety endpoints included head circumference, weight, height, congenital abnormality and hospitalization rates. In addition, the Denver Developmental Screening Test was performed in 92 randomly selected infants. None of the 214 infants born to these women were infected with HBV, and all had effective serum hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb) levels. Compared with Chinese standard values, there were few differences in the infants' mean head circumference, weight, and height values. No birth defects were diagnosed, and the congenital abnormality rate was 0.934%. Serious adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in 20 infants (9.35%). The qualified Denver Developmental Screening Test rate in 92 infants was 97.82%, which was comparable to a rate of 92% in normal Chinese children.

"Developmental mechanisms leading to lung hypoplasia in congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) remain poorly defined. Pulmonary innervation is defective in the human disease and in the rodent models of CDH. We hypothesize that defective parasympathetic innervation may contribute to airway branching abnormalities and, therefore, lung hypoplasia, during lung development in CDH. The murine nitrofen model of CDH was utilized to study the effect of the cholinergic agonist carbachol on embryonic day 11.5 (E11.5) lung explant cultures. Airway branching and contractions were quantified. In a subset of experiments, verapamil was added to inhibit airway contractions. Sox9 immunostaining and 5-bromo-2-deoxyuridine incorporation were used to identify and quantify the number and proliferation of distal airway epithelial progenitor cells. Intra-amniotic injections were used to determine the in vivo effect of carbachol. Airway branching and airway contractions were significantly decreased in nitrofen-treated lungs compared with controls. Carbachol resulted in increased airway contractions and branching in nitrofen-treated lungs. Nitrofen-treated lungs exhibited an increased number of proliferating Sox9-positive distal epithelial progenitor cells, which were decreased and normalized by treatment with carbachol. Verapamil inhibited the carbachol-induced airway contractions in nitrofen-treated lungs but had no effect on the carbachol-induced increase in airway branching, suggesting a direct carbachol effect independent of airway contractions. In vivo treatment of nitrofen-treated embryos via amniotic injection of carbachol at E10.5 resulted in modest increases in lung size and branching at E17.5. These results suggest that defective parasympathetic innervation may contribute to airway branching abnormalities in CDH.

"Background Higher incidence of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) remain a major cause of morbidity and mortality. Most targeted ADR reporting activities are mainly professional-centered with less attention to patients' knowledge, perception and selfreporting of experienced ADRs. Objectives To comprehensively evaluate patients' knowledge, awareness, perception and reporting of experienced ADRs. Setting Three public healthcare facilities in Ibadan, southwestern Nigeria. Method A questionnaire-guided cross-sectional interview of 1190 consented ambulatory adult patients consecutively recruited from various clinics of the selected hospitals between February and June 2018. The 32-item pretested questionnaire comprised open- and closed-ended questions, as well as open-ended questions with relevant prompts. Data were summarised using descriptive statistics, while Chi square was used to investigate association between relevant categorical variables at p < 0.05. Main outcome measure Knowledge, awareness, perception and reporting of experienced ADRs among patients. Results Response rate was 99.1%. Mean age was 40.6 ± 14.9 years. Forty-nine (4.1%) patients were aware of pharmacovigilance. A total of 964 (81.0%) correctly understood what can be regarded as serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs), 444 (37.3%) had previously experienced ADRs, while 77 (6.5%) experienced reactions with current medication(s). Of this, 64 (83.1%) made a report largely to physician (52; 81.3%). Summarily, reported reactions were more with antimalarials (214; 49.1%), with itching (168; 78.5%) constituting the most frequently occurring reaction. Use of text message (276; 27.2%) and filling of ADR report form (248; 24.4%) were topmost on the list of suggested methods for ADR reporting. There was a significant association between patient's age and awareness of pharmacovigilance (p = 0.015), while educational qualification (p = 0.001) significantly influenced tendency to make a report of experienced ADRs. Conclusion Approximately four percent of patients were aware of pharmacovigilance, while more than three-quarters correctly understood the concept of serious adverse drug reactions. A little above one-quarter had previously experienced one form of reaction or the other, with majority reporting such reactions to physician. Continuous education of stakeholders in pharmacovigilance activities is advocated, while patient's active involvement in spontaneous reporting of ADRs should be carefully considered.",31140162,"Knowledge, awareness, perception and reporting of experienced adverse drug reactions among outpatients in Nigeria.",0,1

These studies were conducted to evaluate the potential toxicity and pharmacokinetics in a rodent and a nonrodent species for the purpose of investigational new drug submission. Oral gavage administration of 9-cis-UAB30 at the doses 0, 3, 15, and 100 mg/kg/day to CD® rats for 28 days showed a dose-dependent (although not dose-proportional) increase in plasma drug levels in week 4. The liver was the target organ for toxicity of 9-cis-UAB30. Hepatomegaly along with increases in serum aspartate-aminotransferase and alkaline-phosphatase levels were seen in rats. Moderate hypoalbuminemia and hyperglobulinemia resulted in a decreased albumin/globulin ratio. Histopathology revealed hepatocellular change consistent with hepatic glycogen deposition. Toxicity studies in dogs did not show treatment-related toxicity at doses as high as 100 mg/kg/day (highest dose tested) administered by capsules for 28 days. No effects on the central nervous system (functional observational battery in rats) or cardiovascular function (safety pharmacology study in telemeterized dogs) were seen. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in the rat studies was 3 mg/kg/day; however, the adverse effects seen in rats receiving 15 mg/kg/day (the least observed adverse effect level) was a slight, but statistically significant, elevation in fibrinogen and decrease in prothrombin time, which may be a sign of some tendency for increased blood coagulation.

Asthma and hypertension are complex diseases coinciding more frequently than expected by chance. Unraveling the mechanisms of comorbidity of asthma and hypertension is necessary for choosing the most appropriate treatment plan for patients with this comorbidity. Since both diseases have a strong genetic component in this article we aimed to find and study genes simultaneously associated with asthma and hypertension. We identified 330 shared genes and found that they form six modules on the interaction network. A strong overlap between genes associated with asthma and hypertension was found on the level of eQTL regulated genes and between targets of drugs relevant for asthma and hypertension. This suggests that the phenomenon of comorbidity of asthma and hypertension may be explained by altered genetic regulation or result from drug side effects. In this work we also demonstrate that not only drug indications but also contraindications provide an important source of molecular evidence helpful to uncover disease mechanisms. These findings give a clue to the possible mechanisms of comorbidity and highlight the direction for future research.,31705029,Comorbidity of asthma and hypertension may be mediated by shared genetic dysregulation and drug side effects.,0,1

"Recent decades have seen ultrasound revolutionise the management of pregnancy and its possible complications. However, somewhat less consideration has been given to the psychosocial consequences of mass screening resulting in fetal anomaly detection in low-risk populations, particularly in contexts where termination of pregnancy services are not readily accessible. A grounded theory study was conducted exploring forty-one women's experiences of ultrasound diagnosis of fetal abnormality up to and beyond the birth in the Republic of Ireland. Thirty-one women chose to continue the pregnancy and ten women accessed termination of pregnancy services outside the state. Data were collected using repeated in-depth individual interviews pre- and post-birth and analysed using the constant comparative method. Recasting Hope, the process of adaptation following diagnosis is represented temporally as four phases: 'Assume Normal', 'Shock', 'Gaining Meaning' and 'Rebuilding'. Some mothers expressed a sense of incredulity when informed of the anomaly and the 'Assume Normal' phase provides an improved understanding as to why women remain unprepared for an adverse diagnosis. Transition to phase 2, 'Shock,' is characterised by receiving the diagnosis and makes explicit women's initial reactions. Once the diagnosis is confirmed, a process of 'Gaining Meaning' commences, whereby an attempt to make sense of this ostensibly negative event begins. 'Rebuilding', the final stage in the process, is concerned with the extent to which women recover from the loss and resolve the inconsistency between their experience and their previous expectations of pregnancy in particular and beliefs in the world in general. This theory contributes to the theoretical field of thanatology as applied to the process of grieving associated with the loss of an ideal child. The framework of Recasting Hope is intended for use as a tool to assist health professionals through offering simple yet effective interventions grounded in women's experiences of this event.",19026477,Recasting Hope: a process of adaptation following fetal anomaly diagnosis.,0,0
"Congenital anomalies affect 1% to 2% of the newborns. The urinary tract and the kidneys are involved in 4-5% of the cases while upper-extremities abnormalities are present in 10%. Certain anomalies occur in isolation, whereas others are associated with systemic conditions. The prenatal detection of fetal anomalies compatible with life is a challenge for both the parents and the physician. The prognosis for the fetus/newborn and the reproductive decisions of the family largely depend on the causes underlying the disease. The reported case is of a G2P1 pregnant woman referred for routine ultrasound scan at 24 weeks of gestation (w.g.). The fetus had growth retardation, right kidney agenesis, bilateral absence of radial bones and thumbs, radial deviation of the wrists, and short humeri. Nuchal fold thickness was 5 mm and there was a single umbilical artery. After termination of pregnancy, SNP array genotyping and next-generation sequencing of targeted candidate-genes were performed trying to clarify the etiology of the fetal polymalformative syndrome. A new hypomorphic mutation in FANCD2 gene was found to underlie this fetal anomaly. The case illustrates that patients/families affected by rare monogenic disorders may benefit from application of modern technologies like microarrays and NGS.

"Epizootic outbreaks of congenital malformations in sheep are rare and have, to the best of our knowledge, never been reported before in Europe. This paper describes relevant preliminary findings from the first epizootic outbreak of ovine congenital malformations in the Netherlands. Between 25 November and 20 December 2011, congenital malformations in newborn lambs on sheep farms throughout the country were reported to the Animal Health Service in Deventer. Subsequently, small ruminant veterinary specialists visited these farms and collected relevant information from farmers by means of questionnaires. The deformities varied from mild to severe, and ewes were reported to have given birth to both normal and deformed lambs; both male and female lambs were affected. Most of the affected lambs were delivered at term. Besides malformed and normal lambs, dummy lambs, unable to suckle, were born also on these farms. None of the ewes had shown clinical signs during gestation or at parturition. Dystocia was common, because of the lambs' deformities. Lambs were submitted for post-mortem examination, and samples of brain tissue were collected for virus detection. The main macroscopic findings included arthrogryposis, torticollis, scoliosis and kyphosis, brachygnathia inferior, and mild-to-marked hypoplasia of the cerebrum, cerebellum and spinal cord. Preliminary data from the first ten affected farms suggest that nutritional deficiencies, intoxication, and genetic factors are not likely to have caused the malformations. Preliminary diagnostic analyses of precolostral serum samples excluded border disease virus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, and bluetongue virus. In December 2011, samples of brain tissue from 54 lambs were sent to the Central Veterinary Institute of Wageningen University Research, Lelystad. Real-time PCR detected the presence of a virus, provisionally named the Schmallenberg virus, in brain tissue from 22 of the 54 lambs, which originated from seven of eight farms that had submitted lambs for post-mortem examination. This Schmallenberg virus was first reported in Germany and seems to be related to the Shamonda, Aino, and Akabane viruses, all of which belong to the Simbu serogroup of the genus Orthobunyavirus of the family Bunyaviridae. These preliminary findings suggest that the Schmallenberg virus is the most likely cause of this epizootic of ovine congenital malformations, which is the first such outbreak reported in Europe.",22393844,Epizootic of ovine congenital malformations associated with Schmallenberg virus infection.,1,0

The most striking phenotypic features were the congenital heart abnormalities which have been frequently reported in deletions of the distal part of the long arm of chromosome 5 and in rings leading to a 5q35-5qter deletion. However, the NKX2-5 gene, which has been related to congenital heart defects, was not deleted in our patient, nor presumably to some other patients with 5q35.3-5qter deletion.

"In the United States, an estimate of 1.3 million women suffering from epilepsy are in their childbearing age. Potential teratogenicity of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) is of concern to these women considering pregnancy because discontinuing pharmacotherapy during pregnancy may not be advised due to the risk of seizures that may be dangerous to the mother as well as the fetus.

Our results indicate that various forms of valproic acid, and more importantly, newer generation antiepileptic agents including lamotrigine, topiramate, and gabapentin show signals for either congenital jaw or oral malformation. Although teratogenic potential of valproic acid has long been confirmed, information on teratogenicity of the newer generation antiepileptic drugs is relatively scarce and inconclusive.

"Our aim was to provide a descriptive overview of how the birth defects surveillance and folic acid fortification programs were implemented in Costa Rica-through the establishment of the Registry Center for Congenital Anomalies (Centro de Registro de Enfermedades Congénitas-CREC), and fortification legislation mandates. We estimated the overall prevalence of neural tube defects (i.e., spina bifida, anencephaly and encephalocele) before and after fortification captured by CREC. Prevalence was calculated by dividing the total number of infants born with neural tube defects by the total number of live births in the country (1987-2012).A total of 1,170 newborns with neural tube defects were identified from 1987 to 2012 (1992-1995 data excluded); 628 were identified during the baseline pre-fortification period (1987-1991; 1996-1998); 191 during the fortification period (1999-2002); and 351 during the post-fortification time period (2003-2012). The overall prevalence of neural tube defects decreased from 9.8 per 10,000 live-births (95 % CI 9.1-10.5) for the pre-fortification period to 4.8 per 10,000 live births (95 % CI 4.3-5.3) for the post-fortification period. Results indicate a statistically significant (P < 0.05) decrease of 51 % in the prevalence of neural tube defects from the pre-fortification period to the post-fortification period.

"High-dose bolus exposure of rats to ethylene glycol (EG) causes developmental toxicity mediated by a metabolite, glycolic acid (GA), whose levels increase disproportionately when its metabolism is saturated. However, low-level exposures that do not saturate GA metabolism have a low potential for developmental effects. Toward the goal of developing EG risk assessments based on internal dose metrics, this study examined the differences between fast (bolus) and slow (continuous infusion) dose-rate exposures to EG on developmental outcome and pharmacokinetics. Time-mated female CD rats received sc bolus injections of 0, 1000, or 2000 mg/kg/day of EG on gestation day (GD) 6-15 once daily, whereas three corresponding groups were given the same daily doses as an infusion administered continuously from GD 6-15 via an sc implantable pump. In the sc bolus groups, increases in 11 fetal malformations (major defects) and 12 variations (minor alterations) were seen at the 2000 mg/kg/day dose level, whereas increases in 2 malformations and 2 variations occurred at 1000 mg/kg/day. In contrast, equivalent daily doses of EG given slowly via infusion did not cause any developmental effects. A pharmacokinetics time course was then conducted to compare GD 11-12 kinetics from oral bolus (gavage) exposure versus sc infusion of EG. Although dose rate had a modest impact (8- to 11-fold difference) on peak EG levels, peak levels of GA in maternal blood, kidney, embryo, and exocoelomic fluid were 59, 100, 49, and 56 times higher, respectively, following gavage versus the same dose given by infusion. These data illustrate how high-dose bolus exposure to EG causes a dramatic shift to nonlinear GA kinetics, an event which is highly unlikely to occur following exposures to humans associated with consumer and worker uses.",20952502,The impact of dose rate on ethylene glycol developmental toxicity and pharmacokinetics in pregnant CD rats.,1,1

"Pharmaceutical pregnancy registries document birth defects and other complications reported in pregnancies exposed to specific medications or diseases. A baseline estimate of birth defect prevalence is necessary for comparison. To identify potential teratogenic signals, the pregnancy registry must have a comparator that most closely matches the exposed population and data collection methodology, which are characteristics that vary among the multiplicity of birth defect surveillance systems. The system that yields the most accurate prevalence data may be different from that most closely matching the pregnancy registry methods. State public health programs have highly accurate and precise statistics, but their populations are broader than those of a pharmaceutical pregnancy registry. Large collaborative databases may have a more useful covered population, but there are secondary problems related to data precision. Health care databases enroll large numbers of patients and have good information about exposures and health problems, but the data can be difficult to access and lack useful detail. Exposure-related databases are closer in population definition and collection methods, though the presence of different diseases and exposures can be problematic. Internal comparators are likely to be most useful in formal statistical analysis, but added cost and management burden and may require significantly increased registry enrollment.

"Several commercially available pharmaceutical compounds have been shown to block the IKr current of the cardiac action potential. This effect can cause a prolongation of the electrocardiogram QT interval and a delay in ventricular repolarization. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that all new potential drug candidates be assessed for IKr block to avoid a potentially lethal cardiac arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes. Direct compound interaction with the human ether-a-go-go- related gene (hERG) product, a delayed rectifier potassium channel, has been identified as a molecular mechanism of IKr block. One strategy to identify compounds with hERG liability is to monitor hERG current inhibition using electrophysiology techniques. The authors describe the Ion Works HT instrument as a tool for screening cell lines expressing hERG channels. Based on current amplitude and stability criteria, a cell line was selected and used to perform a 300-compound screen. The screen was able to identify compounds with hERG activity within projects that spanned different therapeutic areas.

"Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is a common complication of several medications and diagnostic agents. It is seen in both inpatient and outpatient settings with variable presentations ranging from mild, reversible injury to advanced kidney disease. Manifestations of drug-induced nephrotoxicity include acid-base abnormalities, electrolyte imbalances, urine sediment abnormalities, proteinuria, pyuria, hematuria, and, most commonly, a decline in the glomerular filtration rate. The mechanisms of drug-induced nephrotoxicity may differ between various drugs or drug classes, and they are generally categorized based on the histological component of the kidney that is affected. Aminoglycoside antibiotics, radiocontrast media, conventional nonselective nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, amphotericin B, and angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been frequently implicated.

"Arrhythmia management is one of the main challenges in the treatment of adult patients with congenital heart disease (ACHD). Apart from heart failure, arrhythmias are mainly responsible for morbidity and mortality in these patients. Supraventricular tachycardia is more frequent than ventricular arrhythmias and is not only associated with debilitating symptoms, but is often as threatening as ventricular tachycardia. The incidence depends on the underlying defect, type, and time of repair. For the overall ACHD population the incidence of supraventricular tachycardia is up to 50 % and increases with age and time since surgery. Arrhythmia substrate relates to structural abnormalities due to the congenital defect and most importantly to the amount of incisions and material used for repair. In addition, poor hemodynamic conditions influence substrate through dilatation, hypertrophy, and fibrosis. Both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias are due to a macroreentrant mechanism in the vast majority of patients, but focal arrhythmias occasionally occur as well.

"Since 1978 the Swedish catalogue of registered pharmaceutical specialties (FASS) has carried a special section entitled ""Pregnancy and breast-feeding"" in each product presentation, intended to form an aid for the prescription of drugs to women during childbearing and lactation. After a brief review of transplacental transport and milk secretion, reproduction-toxicology studies in animals, and methods for clinical evaluation of drugs for use during pregnancy, the classification system is presented. On the basis of available data with regard to effects on early and late stages of pregnancy and labour, all the pharmaceutical specialties concerned are assigned to one of the following pregnancy categories: A, B 1, B 2, B 3, C or D. The letters refer to information based on findings in man, and the figures to information based on animal data. For drugs in categories B 3, C or D any harmful effects observed or likely to occur in man or animals are to be specified. The pregnancy categories are defined as follows: Category A. Drugs which may be assumed to have been used by a large number of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, without any form of definite disturbance in the reproductive process having been noted so far, e.g. an increased incidence of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus. Category B. Drugs which may be assumed to have been used by only a limited number of pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, without any form of definite disturbance in the reproduction process having been noted so far, e.g. an increased incidence of malformations or other direct or indirect harmful effects on the fetus. Category C. Drugs which by their pharmacological effects have caused, or must be suspected of causing disturbances in the reproduction process that may involve risk to the fetus without being directly teratogenic. Category D. Drugs which have caused an increased incidence of fetal malformations or other permanent damage in man or which on the basis of e.g. reproduction-toxicology studies must be suspected of doing so. This category comprises drugs with primary teratogenic effects. If the drug also has pharmacological effects that may directly or indirectly have a harmful effect on the fetus, this must also be stated. As experience of effects of drugs in Category B is limited, results of reproduction-toxicology studies in animals are indicated by allocation to one of three subgroups according to the following definitions: Category B 1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",6393685,Drug use during pregnancy and breast-feeding.

"Birth Defect Registries provide a basis for epidemiological research into risk factors, thus facilitating a growing understanding of what causes congenital anomalies and how one might target preventive public health actions and reduce inequalities. The National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) has used 10 U.S. registries as a basis for a large case-control study. This commentary reviews its methodology and selected areas of output. The strengths of NBDPS lie in the quality of diagnostic coding and classification of birth defects and its size. The sources of bias in NBDPS data relate particularly to retrospective exposure ascertainment entailing a long period of recall, incomplete ascertainment of terminations of pregnancy for fetal anomaly, and unknown bias in case selection. NBDPS results have shown the protective effect of healthy dietary patterns, but have not been as informative as expected in relation to furthering understanding of the protective effect of folic acid. NBDPS medication studies are making important contributions to addressing the gap in existing evidence systematically across a wide range of birth defects, but are challenged by the quality of information on exposure, dose and underlying disease condition, and the interpretation of results of multiple testing. Studies of environmental contaminants in collaboration with experts in exposure assessment have linked addresses to residential exposure measures, using the advantages of information on residential history and confounders, but are challenged by the need to consider exposure mixtures.

The side-effects of central neural systems are relatively easy to be observed and conspicuous and sensitive to judgments with or by fixed grading systems.

"Marked prolongation of the QT interval and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia following medication (drug-induced long QT syndrome, diLQTS) is a severe adverse drug reaction (ADR) that phenocopies congenital long QT syndrome (cLQTS) and is one of the leading causes for drug withdrawal and relabeling. We evaluated the frequency of rare non-synonymous variants in genes contributing to the maintenance of heart rhythm in cases of diLQTS using targeted capture coupled to next-generation sequencing. Eleven of 31 diLQTS subjects (36%) carried a novel missense mutation in genes with known congenital arrhythmia associations or with a known cLQTS mutation. In the 26 Caucasian subjects, 23% carried a highly conserved rare variant predicted to be deleterious to protein function in these genes compared with only 2-4% in public databases (P<0.003). We conclude that the rare variation in genes responsible for congenital arrhythmia syndromes is frequent in diLQTS.

"Preclinical studies in rodents have demonstrated that artemisinins, especially injectable artesunate, can induce fetal death and congenital malformations at a low dose range. The embryotoxicity can be induced in those animals only within a narrow window in early embryogenesis. Evidence was presented that the mechanism by which embryotoxicity of artemisinins occurs seems to be limited to fetal erythropoiesis and vasculogenesis/ angiogenesis on the very earliest developing red blood cells, causing severe anemia in the embryos with higher drug peak concentrations. However, this embryotoxicity has not been convincingly observed in clinical trials from 1,837 pregnant women, including 176 patients in the first trimester exposed to an artemisinin agent or artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) from 1989 to 2009. In the rodent, the sensitive early red cells are produced synchronously over one day with single or multiple exposures to the drug can result in a high proportion of cell deaths. In contrast, primates required a longer period of treatment of 12 days to induce such embryonic loss. In humans only limited information is available about this stage of red cell development; however, it is known to take place over a longer time period, and it may well be that a limited period of treatment of 2 to 3 days for malaria would not produce serious toxic effects. In addition, current oral intake, the most commonly used route of administration in pregnant women with an ACT, results in lower peak concentration and shorter exposure time of artemisinins that demonstrated that such a concentration-course profile is unlikely to induce the embryotoxicity. When relating the animal and human toxicity of artemisinins, the different drug sensitive period and pharmacokinetic profiles as reviewed in the present report may provide a great margin of safety in the pregnant women.",20110870,"Severe embryotoxicity of artemisinin derivatives in experimental animals, but possibly safe in pregnant women.",1,1

"Sacral agenesis is a rare birth defect characterized by partial or complete absence of the sacrum. We sought to (a) describe case characteristics, (b) estimate birth prevalence, and (c) identify risk factors for nonsyndromic sacral agenesis using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS). The NBDPS was a population-based, case-control study involving pregnancies with estimated dates of delivery from October 1997 through December 2011. We estimated birth prevalence using all NBDPS eligible cases. Using self-reported maternal exposure information, we conducted multivariable logistic regression analysis to identify potential risk factors overall and among women without diabetes. The birth prevalence of sacral agenesis was 2.6/100,000 live births. In the multivariable analysis, multifetal pregnancy, pre-existing Type 1 diabetes, and pre-existing Type 2 diabetes were positively and significantly associated with sacral agenesis, albeit estimates were imprecise. Preexisting Type 1 diabetes was the strongest risk factor (adjusted odds ratio = 96.6, 95% confidence interval = 43.5-214.7). Among women without diabetes, periconceptional smoking was positively and significantly associated with sacral agenesis. Our findings underscore the importance of smoking cessation programs among women planning pregnancy and the importance of better understanding the role of glycemic control before and during pregnancy when designing interventions for primary prevention of sacral agenesis.",31294918,"Descriptive and risk factor analysis of nonsyndromic sacral agenesis: National Birth Defects Prevention Study, 1997-2011.",1,0
"Prolongation of the ventricular repolarisation manifests itself as a prolongation of the QT intervall on the surface ECG and represents a major risk for a special form of ventricular tachycardia called ""torsades de pointes"". Torsades de pointes are often self limited and are associated with palpitations, dizziness or syncope. Degeneration into ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death can occur. In addition to the various forms of the congenital long QT syndrome many drugs, such as antiarrhythmic drugs class IA and III, antibiotics, antihistamines, antidepressants, and methadone are known to prolong the QT interval. Most of these drugs block a specific potassium channel substantially involved in the ventricular repolarisation. In addition, drug interaction or disturbances of drug metabolism may play a major role in the acquired form of the long QT syndrome. The individual risk and the potential of a pharmacologic substance to prolong the QT interval are not predictable. Certain risk factors identify patients at higher risk for drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval. Correctable factors include electrolyte disorders (e.g. hypokalemia) and concomitant administration of different QT prolonging drugs. External defibrillation is the therapy of choice in the hemodynamic unstable patient presenting torsades de pointes. In hemodynamic more stable patients application of intravenous magnesium can terminate torsades de pointes (membrane stabilizing properties). Temporary external or transvenous pacing at high heart rate might terminate incessant torsades de pointes by decreasing QT interval. Repeated ECG controls during therapy with QT prolonging drugs are mandatory, especially when drug doses are changed, additional drugs are prescribed, or in case of vomiting and diarrhea. QT prolongation in individual medical therapy is not always predictable. Therefore, updated lists of drugs with the potential of QT prolongation are available on the Internet (e.g. www.qtdrugs.org ).",18365152,[Drug induced QT prolongation].,1,1

"The investigation of inherited disorders of erythropoiesis has elucidated many of the principles underlying the production of normal red blood cells and how this is perturbed in human disease.

Consequently, the pathways affected in CDA-I remain to be discovered. To enable detailed analysis of this rare disorder we have validated a culture system which recapitulates all of the cardinal haematological features of CDA-I, including the formation of the pathognomonic 'spongy' heterochromatin seen by electron microscopy. Using a variety of cell and molecular biological approaches we discovered that erythroid cells in this condition show a delay during terminal erythroid differentiation, associated with increased proliferation and widespread changes in chromatin accessibility. We also show that the proteins encoded by CDAN1 and CDIN1 are enriched in nucleoli which are structurally and functionally abnormal in CDA-I. Together these findings provide important pointers to the pathways affected in CDA-I which for the first time can now be pursued in the tractable culture system utilised here.",33121234,Recapitulation of erythropoiesis in congenital dyserythropoietic anaemia type I (CDA-I) identifies defects in differentiation and nucleolar abnormalities.,1,0

"Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) may be primary, due to a defect affecting the thyroid gland itself, or central, due to impaired thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)-mediated stimulation of the thyroid gland as a result of hypothalamic or pituitary pathology. Primary CH is the most common neonatal endocrine disorder, traditionally subdivided into thyroid dysgenesis (TD), referring to a spectrum of thyroid developmental abnormalities, and dyshormonogenesis, where a defective molecular pathway for thyroid hormonogenesis results in failure of hormone production by a structurally intact gland. Delayed treatment of neonatal hypothyroidism may result in profound neurodevelopmental delay; therefore, CH is screened for in developed countries to facilitate prompt diagnosis. Central congenital hypothyroidism (CCH) is a rarer entity which may occur in isolation, or (more frequently) in association with additional pituitary hormone deficits.

"The aim was to study the impact of therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) on paediatric patients on lamotrigine therapy and the evaluation of possible drug interactions, especially in triple antiepileptic drug combinations. During the period of 2001-2015, 1308 pre-dose samples were taken from 430 patients <15 years of age as part of routine TDM. Drug interactions were evaluated using calculation of lamotrigine clearance. Valproic acid decreased lamotrigine clearance by 54% in bitherapy, and by 21% in triple therapy with carbamazepine. Carbamazepine increased lamotrigine clearance by 191% in bitherapy. Levetiracetam and topiramate had no effect. The upper limit of lamotrigine therapeutic range (TR) was exceeded in 2% of cases in monotherapy, and in 6%-7% of cases in bi- or triple therapy. About 61% of plasma levels were found within the TR during 2001-2005, compared to 75% and 74% during 2006-2010 and 2011-2015, respectively. Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) were reported in 22 cases. Higher number of supratherapeutic levels in combination therapy led to a 3-fold increase in incidence of ADRs. Seizures occurred more often daily and monthly during 2001-2005 and in patients with three or four antiepileptic drugs in combination. Carbamazepine only partially compensated for the inhibitory effect of valproic acid. Lamotrigine clearance in monotherapy in children is similar to adults, but in polytherapy was found higher susceptibility to induction.

"In recent years, the safety problems and events of traditional Chinese medicine represented by liver injury have occurred frequently.

"To achieve sensitive and specific mechanism-based prediction of drug toxicity, the tools of systems pharmacology will be integrated using structured ontological approaches, analytics, mathematics, and statistics. Success of this effort is based on the assumption that a systems network that consists of drug-induced perturbations of physiological functions can be characterized. This network spans the hierarchy of biological organization, from gene to mRNA to protein to intracellular organelle to cell to organ to organism. It is populated with data from each of these levels of biological organization. These data, from disparate sources, include the published literature, drug development archives of all approved drugs and drug candidates that did not complete development, and various toxicity databases and adverse event reporting systems. The network contains interrelated genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics data, as well as organ and physiological functional data that are derived from the universe of information that describes and analyzes drug toxicity. Here we describe advances in bioinformatics, computer sciences, next-generation sequencing, and systems biology that create the opportunity for integrated systems pharmacology-based prediction of drug safety.",23140241,Systems pharmacology to predict drug toxicity: integration across levels of biological organization.,0,0

"Living in the vicinity of nuclear power plants (NPP) is discussed here in terms of adverse health effects. A prospective population-based cohort study was conducted to evaluate whether the prevalence of birth defects in the vicinity of NPPs is elevated and scrutinize a possible distance correlation. A birth cohort born to mothers living within 10 km of two selected NPPs (study region) was compared to a region without NPP (comparison region), and an active surveillance of all live births, stillbirths, and induced abortions in the defined regions was performed. Between 01/2007 and 02/2008, all newborns were examined by specially trained study paediatricians according to the protocols of the Birth Registry Mainz Model. The cohort consisted of 5,273 infants (90% completeness). The outcome measure was an infant with birth defect(s). The prevalence of infants with birth defects was 4.5% in the study region and 4.7% in the comparison region, which corresponds to a relative risk (RR) of 0.94 (lower 95% confidence level (CL): 0.76). Thus, the prevalence of birth defects in the regions surrounding NPPs was not increased compared to those of the comparison region. Adjustment for potential confounders did not substantially change the result (RR 0.90, lower 95% CL 0.73). The adjusted and unadjusted distance approach (1/distance in km) did not show any correlation to vicinity to a NPP (p = 0.38). Specifically, within the study region, the prevalence of birth defects showed no upward trend with decreasing distance.

"The use of intravitreal antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injection is gaining wide acceptance as an off-label therapy for diseases that may affect pregnant women. However, these drugs may cause systemic side effects in the mother and fetal harm. This could lead specialists to not administer the drug or women to abort the fetus or to refuse treatment during pregnancy. We report the course of pregnancy in 3 women treated with intravitreal bevacizumab and provide a review of the literature on the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF in pregnancy. Our patients did not have any drug-related adverse event and delivered healthy full-term infants, although one of the women had risk factors for miscarriage. Infants reached all developmental milestones appropriately during infancy. A literature search on the use of intravitreal anti-VEGF injection in pregnancy was undertaken. Data for this review were identified by searches of PubMed and references from relevant articles using the search terms ""pegaptanib,"" ""bevacizumab,"" ""ranibizumab,"" ""aflibercept,"" ""anti-VEGF,"" ""intravitreal injection,"" ""pregnant,"" ""pregnancy,"" ""abortion,"" ""miscarriage,"" ""preeclampsia,"" ""embryo-fetal toxicity,"" ""fetal malformations,"" ""teratogenesis,"" ""adverse events,"" and ""maternofetal complications"" in multiple combinations. We believe that intravitreal anti-VEGF can be given during pregnancy only when potential benefit to the woman justifies the potential risks to the fetus. When making a decision about whether to give drugs during pregnancy, it is important to consider the timing of exposure and its relationship to windows of developmental sensitivity. We believe that this review will be useful to specialists to inform and possibly treat their pregnant patients.

"Patient satisfaction is viewed as a significant indicator of quality of care. More specifically, improving patient satisfaction related to communication about medications and potential side effects can improve healthcare outcomes. Patient satisfaction scores related to medication side effects on a neuro-medical surgical unit were monitored following a quality improvement program. These patients frequently experience cognitive impairment and functional difficulties that can affect the way they understand and handle medications. The purpose of this quality improvement practice change was to (a) develop an educational approach for post acute neurosurgical patients and (b) evaluate whether the use of the approach is successful in improving patient satisfaction scores related to medication education on side effects. The quality improvement program interventions included (a) patient informational handouts inserted into admission folders, (b) nurse education about the importance of providing education on side effects to patient and discussion of their involvement with the program, (c) unit flyers with nurse education, and (d) various communications with bedside nurses through personal work mail and emails.

"Between 1958 and 1961 approximately 10,000 children with severe limb defects were born, whose mothers had taken the somnifacient thalidomid. Since then, pharmaceutical agents in pregnancy are applied with legitimate caution by the pharmaceutical industry, physicians and patients, although often accompanied by irrational panic. According to statistical inquests, 15 to 50 percent of expectant mothers take pharmaceutical agents in the first trimester of pregnancy, often being not aware of their pregnancy. Considering the sensitive phase of organogenesis, the consequences may be particularly fatal in the first three months of pregnancy. After thalidomid more teratogenic pharmaceutical agents were discovered, i.e. coumarin derivates (e.g. warfarin), vitamin A and its derivates (e.g. isotretinoin), antifolates or anticonvulsants such as hydantoin or valproic acid. A number of other drugs are supposed to be potentially embryotoxic/fetotoxic, the effect of those pharmaceutical agents above all depending on dose and time of exposure. Case reports on malformations are available for numerous drugs, but studies with statistical validity are often missing. The pharmaceutical industry takes a legally safe position noting ""contraindication"" or at least ""strict indication"" in the consumer information. Concerning expectant mothers with chronic diseases like epilepsy, hypertension or bronchial asthma a therapeutic nihilism may lead to a dramatic deterioration of the disease, thereby causing high risks in fetal development. On the other hand numerous abortions without profound indications are carried out due to insufficient information of patients and medical staff on the real risks of a medication during early pregnancy. On principle reliable drugs should be preferred to new agents during fertile age of women. Special information centres for reproductive toxicology with corresponding data banks should be established and consulted, if an exposure with an insufficiently tested substance has taken place in ignorance of pregnancy.",10549233,[Pharmacotherapy in pregnancy].,1,1

"Unknown adverse reactions to drugs available on the market present a significant health risk and limit accurate judgement of the cost/benefit trade-off for medications. Machine learning has the potential to predict unknown adverse reactions from current knowledge. We constructed a knowledge graph containing four types of node: drugs, protein targets, indications and adverse reactions. Using this graph, we developed a machine learning algorithm based on a simple enrichment test and first demonstrated this method performs extremely well at classifying known causes of adverse reactions (AUC 0.92). A cross validation scheme in which 10% of drug-adverse reaction edges were systematically deleted per fold showed that the method correctly predicts 68% of the deleted edges on average. Next, a subset of adverse reactions that could be reliably detected in anonymised electronic health records from South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust were used to validate predictions from the model that are not currently known in public databases. High-confidence predictions were validated in electronic records significantly more frequently than random models, and outperformed standard methods (logistic regression, decision trees and support vector machines). This approach has the potential to improve patient safety by predicting adverse reactions that were not observed during randomised trials.",29180758,Knowledge graph prediction of unknown adverse drug reactions and validation in electronic health records.,0,1

"Causes for miscarriages and congenital malformations can be genetic, environmental, or a combination of both. Genetic variants, hypoxia, malnutrition, or other factors individually may not affect embryo development, however, they may do so collectively. Biallelic loss-of-function variants in <i>HAAO</i> or <i>KYNU</i>, two genes of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) synthesis pathway, are causative of congenital malformation and miscarriage in humans and mice. The variants affect normal embryonic development by disrupting the synthesis of NAD, a key factor in multiple biological processes, from its dietary precursor tryptophan, resulting in NAD deficiency. This study demonstrates that congenital malformations caused by NAD deficiency can occur independent of genetic disruption of NAD biosynthesis. C57BL/6J wild-type mice had offspring exhibiting similar malformations when their supply of the NAD precursors tryptophan and vitamin B3 in the diet was restricted during pregnancy. When the dietary undersupply was combined with a maternal heterozygous variant in <i>Haao</i>, which alone does not cause NAD deficiency or malformations, the incidence of embryo loss and malformations was significantly higher, suggesting a gene-environment interaction. Maternal and embryonic NAD levels were deficient. Mild hypoxia as an additional factor exacerbated the embryo outcome. Our data show that NAD deficiency as a cause of embryo loss and congenital malformation is not restricted to the rare cases of biallelic mutations in NAD synthesis pathway genes. Instead, monoallelic genetic variants and environmental factors can result in similar outcomes. The results expand our understanding of the causes of congenital malformations and the importance of sufficient NAD precursor consumption during pregnancy.",32015132,NAD deficiency due to environmental factors or gene-environment interactions causes congenital malformations and miscarriage in mice.,1,0

"Drugs are designed for therapy, but medication-related adverse events are common, and risk/benefit analysis is critical for determining clinical use. Rosiglitazone, an efficacious antidiabetic drug, is associated with increased myocardial infarctions (MIs), thus limiting its usage. Because diabetic patients are often prescribed multiple drugs, we searched for usage of a second drug (""drug B"") in the Food and Drug Administration's Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) that could mitigate the risk of rosiglitazone (""drug A"")-associated MI. In FAERS, rosiglitazone usage is associated with increased occurrence of MI, but its combination with exenatide significantly reduces rosiglitazone-associated MI. Clinical data from the Mount Sinai Data Warehouse support the observations from FAERS. Analysis for confounding factors using logistic regression showed that they were not responsible for the observed effect. Using cell biological networks, we predicted that the mitigating effect of exenatide on rosiglitazone-associated MI could occur through clotting regulation. Data we obtained from the db/db mouse model agreed with the network prediction. To determine whether polypharmacology could generally be a basis for adverse event mitigation, we analyzed the FAERS database for other drug combinations wherein drug B reduced serious adverse events reported with drug A usage such as anaphylactic shock and suicidality. This analysis revealed 19,133 combinations that could be further studied. We conclude that this type of crowdsourced approach of using databases like FAERS can help to identify drugs that could potentially be repurposed for mitigation of serious adverse events.

"Often, in follow-up studies, patients experience intermediate events, such as reinterventions or adverse events, which directly affect the shapes of their longitudinal profiles. Our work is motivated by two studies in which such intermediate events have been recorded during follow-up. In both studies, we are interested in the change of the longitudinal evolutions after the occurrence of the intermediate event and in utilizing this information to improve the accuracy of dynamic prediction of their risk. To achieve so, we propose a flexible joint modeling framework for longitudinal and time-to-event data, which includes features of the intermediate event as time-varying covariates in both the longitudinal and survival submodels. We consider a set of joint models that postulate different effects of the intermediate event in the longitudinal profile and the risk of the clinical endpoint, with different formulations for the association structure while allowing its functional form to change after the occurrence of the intermediate event. Based on these models, we derive dynamic predictions of conditional survival probabilities which are adaptive to different scenarios with respect to the occurrence of the intermediate event. We evaluate the predictive accuracy of these predictions with a simulation study using the time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and the expected prediction error adjusted to our setting. The results suggest that accounting for the changes in the longitudinal profiles and the instantaneous risk for the clinical endpoint is important, and improves the accuracy of the dynamic predictions.",31667885,Individualized dynamic prediction of survival with the presence of intermediate events.,1,1
"Certain pituitary imaging abnormalities are a specific indicator of hypopituitarism.

Magnetic Resonance imaging (MRI) was performed in 103 patients [72 with Isolated GHD (IGHD) and 31 with Combined Pituitary Hormone Deficiency (CPHD)]. Images were assessed for the following abnormalities: (1) small/absent anterior pituitary, (2) thin or interrupted pituitary stalk (PSA), and (3) Ectopic posterior pituitary (EPP), and (4) others. Radiological findings were correlated with the clinical and biochemical parameters. MRI abnormalities were observed in 48.6% patients with IGHD, 93.5% with CPHD. Jaundice, hypoxia, hypoglycemia and breech deliveries were more common in EPP/PSA group. EPP/PSA was observed in 87.1% patients with severe GHD (peak GH < 3 μg/L) as compared to 12.9% with mild to moderate GHD (peak GH: 3-10 μg/L). Amongst CPHD, EPP/PSA was present in 80% of subjects with associated hypocortisolism ± hypothyroidism as compared to 18.2% of subjects with hypogonadism. Over a mean follow up period of 4.5 years, 5.4% of subjects with IGHD and abnormal MRI progressed to CPHD while none of those with normal MRI progressed.

Yet, we see a clear disconnect between the way side effects are normalized, routinized, and framed in clinical practice and the way they are experienced by people living with HIV. This paper builds on the premise that new approaches are needed to understand side effects in a manner that is more reflective of the subjective accounts of people living with HIV. Drawing on the work of Deleuze and Guattari, it offers an original application of the theory of 'assemblage'. This theory offers a new way of theorizing side effects, and ultimately the relationship between the body and antiretroviral drugs (as technologies). Combining theory with examples derived from empirical data, we examine the multiple ways in which the body connects not only to the drugs but also to people, things, and systems. Our objective is to illustrate how this theory dares us to think differently about side effects and allows us to originally (re)think the experience of taking antiretroviral drugs.

"GM2 gangliosidosis (GM2g) is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by deficiency of lysosomal beta-hexosaminidase A, resulting in accumulation of GM2 ganglioside, principally in the brain. Substrate reduction therapy is currently under investigation as a treatment. The study investigated the pharmacokinetics and safety of miglustat given as single and multiple doses in infantile and juvenile GM2g patients for 6- and 24-months, respectively. Eleven patients with infantile (n = 6) and juvenile (n = 5) GM2g received oral miglustat at 30-200 mg t.i.d. adjusted to the body surface area. Patients underwent pharmacokinetic assessments on day 1 and at month 3. The pharmacokinetics of miglustat were described by a 2-compartmental model with a lag time, median time to maximum concentration of 2.5 h, and terminal half-life of about 10 h. The pharmacokinetics were time-independent, and did not differ between infantile and juvenile cohorts. The accumulation index was 1.7. Among infantile GM2g patients, the major drug-related adverse events (DRAEs) were abdominal discomfort and flatulence. In the juvenile group, however, the major DRAEs observed were diarrhea and weight loss. One juvenile patient developed peripheral neuropathy, and others showed progression of already established neuropathy, which was judged to be part of the natural progression of the disease. Some mild laboratory abnormalities observed were either transient or attributable to concomitant medications. Miglustat showed similar pharmacokinetic parameters in all patients, with no specific difference between infantile and juvenile forms. Miglustat was shown to be a safe drug, with mild to moderate diarrhea, as an age-dependent DRAE, which was controlled by dietary modification.",19447653,"Pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of miglustat in the treatment of pediatric patients with GM2 gangliosidosis.",1,1

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) reduce patients' quality of life, increase mortality and morbidity, and have a negative economic impact on healthcare systems. Nevertheless, the importance of ADR reporting is often underestimated. The project ""FarmaREL"" has been developed to monitor and evaluate ADRs in haematological patients and to increase pharmacovigilance culture among haematology specialists. In 13 haematology units, based in Lombardy, Italy, a dedicated specialist with the task of encouraging ADRs reporting and sensitizing healthcare professionals to pharmacovigilance has been assigned. The ADRs occurring in haematological patients were collected electronically and then analysed with multiple logistic regression. Between January 2009 and December 2011, 887 reports were collected. The number of ADRs was higher in older adults (528; 59%), in male (490; 55%), and in non-Hodgkin lymphoma patients (343; 39%). Most reactions were severe (45% required or prolonged hospitalization), but in most cases, they were fully resolved at the time of reporting. According to Schumock and Thornton criteria, a percentage of ADRs as high as 7% was found to be preventable versus 2% according to reporter opinion. Patients' haematological diagnosis, not age or gender, resulted to be the variable that most influenced ADR, in particular severity and outcome. The employment of personnel specifically dedicated to pharmacovigilance is a successful strategy to improve the number and quality of ADR reports.

"Agricultural compounds have been detected in drinking water, some of which are teratogens in animal models. The most commonly detected agricultural compounds in drinking water include nitrate, atrazine, and desethylatrazine. Arsenic can also be an agricultural contaminant, although arsenic often originates from geologic sources. Nitrate has been the most studied agricultural compound in relation to prenatal exposure and birth defects. In several case-control studies published since 2000, women giving birth to babies with neural tube defects, oral clefts, and limb deficiencies were more likely than control mothers to be exposed to higher concentrations of drinking water nitrate during pregnancy. Higher concentrations of atrazine in drinking water have been associated with abdominal defects, gastroschisis, and other defects. Elevated arsenic in drinking water has also been associated with birth defects. Since these compounds often occur as mixtures, it is suggested that future research focus on the impact of mixtures, such as nitrate and atrazine, on birth defects.

"The utility of halothane-anaesthetized guinea-pigs as an in vivo model for predicting the clinical potential of a drug to induce QT interval prolongation was assessed using the electrocardiogram and monophasic action potential (MAP) recordings with electrical ventricular pacing. Intravenous administration of D-sotalol (0.3 mg kg(-1)) and terfenadine (0.3 mg kg(-1)), blockers of a rapid component of delayed rectifier potassium currents, prolonged the QT interval by 32+/-7 and 23+/-6 ms, respectively, whereas chromanol 293B (1 mg kg(-1)), a blocker of a slow component of delayed rectifier potassium currents, lengthened it by 33+/-8 ms. The extent of the QT interval prolongation by these drugs was greater than those in previous reports using pentobarbital-anaesthetized guinea-pigs. The MAP duration at the control was shortened by decreasing the pacing cycle length from 400 to 200 ms, but the MAP duration at each cycle length was prolonged by D-sotalol. The formulas of Van de Water, Matsunaga, Fridericia and Bazett showed good correlation of the repolarization period when compared with the MAP duration at a pacing cycle length of 400 ms. The halothane-anaesthetized guinea-pig model may possess enough sensitivity to detect drug-induced QT interval prolongation, indicating that halothane anaesthesia can reduce the repolarization reserve of the heart in vivo.",16056235,Reduction of repolarization reserve by halothane anaesthesia sensitizes the guinea-pig heart for drug-induced QT interval prolongation.,1,1
"Prostaglandin E1 is crucial for keeping the patent ductus arteriosus in critical congenital heart disease for the survival and palliation of particularly prematurely born babies until a cardiosurgical intervention is available. In this study, the side effects of prostaglandin E1 in newborns with critical congenital heart disease and clinical outcomes were evaluated. Thirty-five newborns diagnosed with critical congenital heart disease were treated with prostaglandin E1 between January 2012 and September 2014 at our hospital. Patient charts were examined for prostaglandin E1 side effects (metabolic, gastric outlet obstruction, apnea), clinical status, and prognosis. Acquired data were analyzed in the SPSS 20.0 program. Patients with birth weight under 2500 g needed more days of prostaglandin E1 infusion than ones with birthweight over 2500 g (P = 0.016). The ratio of patients with birth weight under 2500 g who received prostaglandin E1 longer than 7 days was higher than the patients with birth weight over 2500 g (P = 0.02). Eighteen side effects were encountered in 11 of 35 patients (31%). Of these side effects, 1 patient had 4, 4 patients had 2, and 6 patients had only 1 side effect. Discontinuation of the therapy was never needed. Prostaglandin E1 is an accepted therapy modality for survival and outcome in critical congenital heart disease in particularly low-birth-weight babies until a surgical intervention is available.

"Birth defects occur in up to 3% of all live births and are the leading cause of infant death. Here we present five individuals from four unrelated families, individuals who share similar phenotypes with disease-causal bi-allelic variants in NADSYN1, encoding NAD synthetase 1, the final enzyme of the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) de novo synthesis pathway. Defects range from the isolated absence of both kidneys to multiple malformations of the vertebrae, heart, limbs, and kidney, and no affected individual survived for more than three months postnatally. NAD is an essential coenzyme for numerous cellular processes. Bi-allelic loss-of-function mutations in genes required for the de novo synthesis of NAD were previously identified in individuals with multiple congenital abnormalities affecting the heart, kidney, vertebrae, and limbs. Functional assessments of NADSYN1 missense variants, through a combination of yeast complementation and enzymatic assays, show impaired enzymatic activity and severely reduced NAD levels. Thus, NADSYN1 represents an additional gene required for NAD synthesis during embryogenesis, and NADSYN1 has bi-allelic missense variants that cause NAD deficiency-dependent malformations.

"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are reshaping the prognosis of many cancer and are progressively becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many tumour types. Immunotherapy is bringing new hope to patients, but also a whole new spectrum of toxicities for healthcare practitioners to manage. Oncologists and specialists involved in the pluridisciplinary management of patients with cancer are increasingly confronted with the therapeutic challenge of treating patients with severe and refractory immune-related adverse events. In this Personal View, we summarise the therapeutic strategies that have been used to manage such toxicities resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. On the basis of current knowledge about their pathogenesis, we discuss the use of new biological and non-biological immunosuppressive drugs to treat severe and steroid refractory immune-related adverse events. Depending on the immune infiltrate type that is predominant, we propose a treatment algorithm for personalised management that goes beyond typical corticosteroid use. We propose a so-called shut-off strategy that aims at inhibiting key inflammatory components involved in the pathophysiological processes of immune-related adverse events, and limits potential adverse effects of drug immunosuppression on tumour response. This approach develops on current guidelines and challenges the step-by-step increase approach to drug immunosuppression.",30614479,New therapeutic perspectives to manage refractory immune checkpoint-related toxicities.,0,1
"An aging population and the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases have led to the increased use of medicines. Portugal is one of the European countries where more medicines are consumed and the associated expense is higher.

"Delirium is a common and serious acute neuropsychiatric syndrome with core features of inattention and cognitive impairment, and associated features including changes in arousal, altered sleep-wake cycle, and other changes in mental status. The main risk factors are old age, cognitive impairment, and other comorbidities. Though delirium has consistent core clinical features, it has a very wide range of precipitating factors, including acute illness, surgery, trauma, and drugs. The molecular mechanisms by which these precipitating factors lead to delirium are largely obscure. In this article, we attempt to narrow down some specific causal pathways. We propose a basic classification for the etiological factors: (a) direct brain insults and (b) aberrant stress responses. Direct brain insults are largely indiscriminate and include general and regional energy deprivation (e.g., hypoxia, hypoglycaemia, stroke), metabolic abnormalities (e.g., hyponatraemia, hypercalcaemia), and the effects of drugs. Aberrant stress responses are conceptually and mechanistically distinct in that they constitute adverse effects of stress-response pathways, which, in health, are adaptive. Ageing and central nervous system disease, two major predisposing factors for delirium, are associated with alterations in the magnitude or duration of stress and sickness behavior responses and increased vulnerability to the effects of these responses. We discuss in detail two stress response systems that are likely to be involved in the pathophysiology of delirium: inflammation and the sickness behavior response, and activity of the limbic-hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. We conclude by discussing the implications for future research and the development of new therapies for delirium.",18707945,Unravelling the pathophysiology of delirium: a focus on the role of aberrant stress responses.,1,1

"Congenital anomalies are the leading cause of infant death in the United States, accounting for 20% of the annual infant mortality. Advancements in ultrasound diagnostic technology allow practitioners to diagnose fetal anomalies as early as 11 weeks' gestational age, 75% of which are detected in low-risk pregnancies. Communicating a fetal anomaly diagnosis to parents and initiating perinatal end-of-life discussions are difficult for healthcare providers and parents alike. Furthermore, poorly communicated diagnoses have had long-term negative impacts on perinatal grief intensity, which can manifest into lifelong symptoms of adverse psychosocial outcomes such as anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation. The purpose of this integrative review is to examine the impact of communication in discussing an intrauterine diagnosis of a fetal congenital anomaly on perinatal grief. An integrative review was conducted following the distinct 5-stage process of problem identification, searching the literature, evaluating data, analyzing, and presenting findings. A systematic literature review using the PICO model (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcome) and structured after the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA). This framework was completed between November 2017 and May 2018 using PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases. Of the 931 article results, 15 satisfied search criteria. Emerging themes included parental need for appropriate time to assimilate and understand the diagnosis, freedom to explore options and alternatives, and the need for clinicians with expert communication skills. The initial conversation communicating the diagnosis of a congenital anomaly impacts expectant parents for the remainder of their lives. Healthcare professionals are in a unique position to either positively or negatively impact the intensity of perinatal grieving reactions.

"Diabetes mellitus (DM) and cancer are global problems carrying huge human, social, and economic impact. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is associated with an increased risk for a number of cancers, including breast, pancreatic, and liver cancer. Moreover, adverse drug reactions are higher in paitents with cancer with T2DM compared to cancer patients without T2DM. Cellular mechanisms of hyperglycemia and chemotherapy efficacy may be different depending upon the particular cancer type and the condition of the patient. This review evaluates the effect of DM on the pharmacokinetic, pharmacodynamic, and adverse drug reactions of commonly used anticancer drugs such as cisplatin, methotrexate, paclitaxel, doxorubicin, and adriamycin in both clinical and animal models. A literature search was conducted in scientific databases including Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar including the relevant keywords. The results of the effectiveness of anticancer therapies in patients with DM are, however, inconsistent because DM can negatively impact multiple diverse entities including nerves and vascular structures, insulin-like growth factor 1, the function of the innate immune system, drug pharmacokinetics, the expression levels of hepatic CYP<sub>450</sub> , Mdr <sub>1b</sub> and enzymes that then lead to drug toxicity. However, in a few circumstances, DM led to attenuation of the toxicity of anticancer drugs secondary to attenuation of the energy-dependent renal uptake process. Overall, the impact of DM on patients with cancer is variable because of the diverse types of cancers and the spectrum of anticancer drugs. With respect to the evidence for cancer involvement in DM pathophysiology and the response to anticancer treatment in patients with DM, many questions still remain and further clinical trials are needed.",31017666,"The effect of diabetes mellitus on pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics and adverse drug reactions of anticancer drugs.",0,1
"The intake of each drug represents an intervention into the complex human                     organism. In addition to the desired therapeutic effect, adverse reactions (AR)                     can occur. Package inserts should inform patients about the safety profile of                     drugs, but how reliable is this information and how are side effects determined?                     To explore this question, we reviewed data related to the ascertainment of                     adverse reactions in clinical research from 1977 to 2011. This article sums up                     the results of our literature research as well as own experiences in clinical                     research.

"Macrocytosis, generally defined as a mean corpuscular volume greater than 100 fL, is frequently encountered when a complete blood count is performed. The most common etiologies are alcoholism, vitamin B12 and folate deficiencies, and medications. History and physical examination, vitamin B12 level, reticulocyte count, and a peripheral smear are helpful in delineating the underlying cause of macrocytosis. When the peripheral smear indicates megaloblastic anemia (demonstrated by macro-ovalocytes and hyper-segmented neutrophils), vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is the most likely cause. When the peripheral smear is non-megaloblastic, the reticulocyte count helps differentiate between drug or alcohol toxicity and hemolysis or hemorrhage. Of other possible etiologies, hypothyroidism, liver disease, and primary bone marrow dysplasias (including myelodysplasia and myeloproliferative disorders) are some of the more common causes.",19202968,Evaluation of macrocytosis.,1,1
"On January 16, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration approved recombinant hemagglutinin influenza vaccine (RIV3) (Spodoptera frugiperda cell line; Flublok), which is the first completely egg-free flu vaccine licensed in the United States. To improve our understanding of the safety profile of this vaccine, we reviewed and summarized reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) following RIV3. Through June 30, 2016, VAERS received 88 reports. Allergic reactions, including anaphylaxis, were the most common type of adverse event. Based on medical review, 10 cases met the Brighton Collaboration case definition of anaphylaxis, 21 reports described allergic reactions other than anaphylaxis, and 11 reports described signs and symptoms that suggested hypersensitivity. Other adverse events included injection site reactions, fatigue, myalgia, headache, and fever. The occurrence of anaphylaxis and other allergic reactions in some individuals may reflect an underlying predisposition to atopy that may manifest itself after an exposure to any drug or vaccine, and it does not necessarily suggest a causal relationship with the unique constituents that are specific to the vaccine product administered. Further research may elucidate the mechanism of allergic reactions following influenza vaccination: it is possible that egg proteins and influenza hemagglutinin play little or no role. Vaccination remains the single best defense against influenza and its complications. The information summarized here may enable policy makers, health officials, clinicians, and patients to make a more informed decision regarding vaccination strategies.",28886946,Postmarketing safety surveillance of trivalent recombinant influenza vaccine: Reports to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.,0,0

"Congenital abnormalities of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) include a wide range of abnormalities ranging from asymptomatic ectopic kidneys to life threatening renal agenesis (bilateral). Many of them are detected in the antenatal or immediate postnatal with a significant proportion identified in the adult population with varying degree of severity. CAKUT can be classified on embryological basis in to abnormalities in the renal parenchymal development, aberrant embryonic migration and abnormalities of the collecting system. Renal parenchymal abnormalities include multi cystic dysplastic kidneys, renal hypoplasia, number (agenesis or supernumerary), shape and cystic renal diseases. Aberrant embryonic migration encompasses abnormal location and fusion anomalies. Collecting system abnormalities include duplex kidneys and Pelvi ureteric junction obstruction. Ultrasonography (US) is typically the first imaging performed as it is easily available, non-invasive and radiation free used both antenatally and postnatally. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are useful to confirm the ultrasound detected abnormality, detection of complex malformations, demonstration of collecting system and vascular anatomy and more importantly for early detection of complications like renal calculi, infection and malignancies. As CAKUT are one of the leading causes of end stage renal disease, it is important for the radiologists to be familiar with the varying imaging appearances of CAKUT on US, CT and MRI, thereby helping in prompt diagnosis and optimal management.

"This article provides a broad overview of our earlier studies on the induction of tumors and congenital anomalies in the progeny of X-irradiated or chemically treated mice and our subsequent (published, hitherto unpublished and on-going) investigations aimed at identifying potential relationships between genetic changes induced in germ cells and the adverse effects manifest as tumors and congenital anomalies using cytogenetic and molecular approaches. The earlier studies document the fact that tumors and congenital anomalies can be induced by irradiation or treatment with certain chemicals such as urethane and that these phenotypes are heritable i.e., transmitted to generations beyond the first generation. These findings support the view that transmissible induced genetic changes are involved. The induced rates of congenital abnormalities and tumors are about two orders of magnitude higher than those recorded in the literature from classical mutation studies with specific locus mutations. The cytogenetic studies addressed the question of whether there were any relationships between induced translocations and induced tumors. The available data permit the inference that gross chromosomal changes may not be involved but do not exclude smaller induced genetic changes that are beyond the resolution of the techniques used in these studies. Other work on possible relationship between visible chromosomal anomalies (in bone marrow preparations) and tumors were likewise negative. However, there were indications that some induced cytogenetic changes might underlie induced congenital anomalies, i.e., trisomies, deletions and inversions were observed in induced and transmissible congenital anomalies (such as dwarfs, tail anomalies). Studies that explored possible relationships between induction of minisatellite mutations at the Pc-3 locus and tumors were negative. However, gene expression analysis of tumor (hepatoma)-susceptible offspring of progeny descended from irradiated male mice showed abnormal expression of many genes. Of these, only very few were oncogenes. This lends some support to our hypothesis that cumulative changes in gene expression of many genes, which perform normal cellular functions, may contribute to the occurrence of tumors in the offspring of irradiated or chemically treated mice.",15162048,Transgenerational transmission of radiation- and chemically induced tumors and congenital anomalies in mice: studies of their possible relationship to induced chromosomal and molecular changes.,1,1

"Pharmacological and cellular treatment of cancer is changing dramatically with benefits for patient outcome and comfort, but also with new toxicity profiles. The majority of adverse events can be classified as mild or moderate, but severe and life-threatening complications requiring ICU admission also occur. This review will focus on pathophysiology, symptoms, and management of these events based on the available literature.While standard antineoplastic therapy is associated with immunosuppression and infections, some of the recent approaches induce overwhelming inflammation and autoimmunity. Cytokine-release syndrome (CRS) describes a complex of symptoms including fever, hypotension, and skin reactions as well as lab abnormalities. CRS may occur after the infusion of monoclonal or bispecific antibodies (MABs, BABs) targeting immune effectors and tumor cells and is a major concern in recipients of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) modified T lymphocytes as well. BAB and CAR T-cell treatment may also be compromised by central nervous system (CNS) toxicities such as encephalopathy, cerebellar alteration, disturbed consciousness, or seizures. While CRS is known to be induced by exceedingly high levels of inflammatory cytokines, the pathophysiology of CNS events is still unclear. Treatment with antibodies against inhibiting immune checkpoints can lead to immune-related adverse events (IRAEs); colitis, diarrhea, and endocrine disorders are often the cause for ICU admissions.Respiratory distress is the main reason for ICU treatment in cancer patients and is attributable to infectious agents in most cases. In addition, some of the new drugs are reported to cause non-infectious lung complications. While drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis was observed in a substantial number of patients treated with phosphoinositol-3-kinase inhibitors, IRAEs may also affect the lungs.Inhibitors of angiogenetic pathways have increased the antineoplastic portfolio. However, vessel formation is also essential for regeneration and tissue repair. Therefore, severe vascular side effects, including thromboembolic events, gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation, hypertension, and congestive heart failure, compromise antitumor efficacy.The limited knowledge of the pathophysiology and management of life-threatening complications relating to new cancer drugs presents a need to provide ICU staff, oncologists, and organ specialists with evidence-based algorithms.",28407743,"New drugs, new toxicities: severe side effects of modern targeted and immunotherapy of cancer and their management.",0,1

"Human pesticide exposure can occur both occupationally and environmentally during manufacture and after the application of indoor and outdoor pesticides, as well as through consumption via residues in food and water. There is evidence from experimental studies that numerous pesticides, either in isolation or in combination, act as endocrine disruptors, neurodevelopmental toxicants, immunotoxicants, and carcinogens. We reviewed the international literature on this subject for the years between 1990 and 2017. The studies were considered in this review through MEDLINE and WHO resources. Out of the n = 1817 studies identified, n = 94 were reviewed because they fulfilled criteria of validity and addressed associations of interest. Epidemiological studies have provided limited evidence linking pre- and post-natal exposure to pesticides with cancers in childhood, neurological deficits, fetal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and congenital abnormalities (CAs). In this review, the potential association between pesticide exposure and the appearance of some human CAs (including among others musculoskeletal abnormalities; neural tube defects; urogenital and cardiovascular abnormalities) was investigated. A trend towards a positive association between environmental or occupational exposure to some pesticides and some CAs was detected, but this association remains to be substantiated. Main limitations of the review include inadequate exposure assessment and limited sample size. Adequately powered studies with precise exposure assessments such as biomonitoring, are warranted to clarify with certainty the potential association between pesticide exposure and human CAs.",29596925,Association of pesticide exposure with human congenital abnormalities.,1,0

WBP11 encodes a component of the spliceosome with the ability to activate pre-mRNA splicing. We generated a Wbp11 null allele in mouse using CRISPR-Cas9 targeting. Wbp11 homozygous null embryos die prior to E8.5, indicating that Wbp11 is essential for development. Fewer Wbp11 heterozygous null mice are found than expected, due to embryonic and postnatal death. Importantly, Wbp11 heterozygous null mice are small and exhibit defects in axial skeleton, kidneys and oesophagus, similar to the affected individuals, supporting the role of WBP11 haploinsufficiency in the development of congenital malformations in humans.

The focus on this review is to identify commonly prescribed medications in the intensive care unit and potential electrolyte disturbances that may occur as a result of their use. This review will also discuss the postulated mechanisms associated with these drug-induced disorders. The specific drug-induced electrolyte disorders discussed in this review involve abnormalities in sodium, potassium, calcium, phosphate, and magnesium.

"The selective estrogen receptor modulator, clomiphene citrate (CC), has been the principal drug used for induction of ovulation in women with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). CC is associated with adverse side effects and low pregnancy rates attributed to long-lasting estrogen receptor depletion. Anastrozole and letrozole are potent, non-steroidal, reversible aromatase inhibitors, developed for postmenopausal breast cancer therapy. We hypothesized that aromatase inhibitors could mimic the action of CC in reducing estrogen negative feedback on follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion, without depleting estrogen receptors. In a series of preliminary studies, we reported the success of aromatase inhibition in inducing ovulation in anovulatory women with PCOS. Moreover, we showed that concomitant use of aromatase inhibitors resulted in a significant reduction of the FSH dose needed for controlled ovarian hyperstimulation. We suggest that aromatase inhibitors act through an increase in endogenous gonadotropin secretion as well as through increased intraovarian androgen levels that may increase ovarian FSH receptors.

Patients filling prescriptions for chronic disorders were recruited. Main outcome measure Perceived sensitivity to medicines. Results The study population included 214 patients (response rate 36.7%). In total 20.1% of the patients reported low, 61.7% moderate and 18.2% high perceived sensitivity to medicines. Factors positively associated with high perceived sensitivity were female gender (Adjusted Odds Ratio (aOR) 5.33, 95% CI 1.52 to 18.72, p < 0.001) and having a non-native language (aOR 4.76, 95% CI 1.48 to 15.30, p < 0.001); lower educational level (aOR 0.43, 95% CI 0.17 to 1.07, p < 0.001) and using generic medicines (aOR 0.12, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.57, p < 0.001) were negatively associated with high perceived sensitivity to medicines. There was no association between the perceived sensitivity and the number of prescription medicines taken. The Norwegian version of the Perceived Sensitivity to Medicines tool demonstrated good psychometric characteristics. Conclusion Almost one out of five patients in this study reported high sensitivity to medicines. Female gender, having a non-native language, lower educational level and using generic medicines were important factors related to the perceived sensitivity.

A total of 26,554 reports were identified, for a reporting rate of 22.8/million inhabitants/year. Reports in female patients prevailed (60.5%), as did white color/race (58.1%). Age ranged from 0 to 112 years (median = 46 years). Nearly one-third (32.5%) of suspected adverse drug reactions occurred in vulnerable populations (elderly and children). A total of 54,288 drug- adverse reactions pairs were analyzed, with a prevalence of severe adverse drug reactions (59.2%), featuring those that resulted in clinically important effects (83.1%). The most frequent drugs in severe adverse drug reactions belonged to groups L, antineoplastic and immunomodulating agents (32.1%), and J, general anti-infectious agents for systemic use (27%), while the most affected system-organ-class was conditions of the skin and related disorders (23.7%).

Pregnant rats were randomly divided into three experimental groups as follows: Control = treated with water (vehicle), treated 250 = treated with H. sucuuba at dose 250 mg/kg, and treated 500 = treated with H. sucuuba at dose 500 mg/kg. The rats were orally treated, by gavage, with H. sucuuba or vehicle (water) during preimplantation and organogenic period (from gestational day 0-14). At day 21 of pregnancy, all rats were killed to obtain maternal-fetal data. The treatment with H. sucuuba at dose of 250 mg/kg caused reduction in placental efficiency and an increase preimplantation loss rate and placenta weight compared with the control. The treated 500 group presented a significant decrease in maternal weight gain, maternal weight gain minus gravid uterus weight, fetal weight, and placental efficiency compared with the control. In this group, there was a decrease in body weight at day 20 of pregnancy and metacarpus ossification and an increase in the preimplantation loss rate and skeletal anomalies compared with other groups.

"Dendrimers based on melamine can reduce the organ toxicity of solubilized cancer drugs administered by intraperitoneal injection. Methotrexate and 6-mercaptopurine, both FDA approved anticancer drugs, are known hepatotoxins. The solubility of these molecules can be increased by mixing them with a dendrimer based on melamine. C3H mice were administered subchronic doses of methotrexate or 6-mercaptopurine with and without a solubilizing dendrimer. Forty-eight hours after dosing, the mice were sacrificed and serum was collected for biochemical analyses. The levels of alanine transaminase, ALT, were used to probe liver damage. When the drugs are encapsulated by the dendrimer, a significant reduction in hepatotoxicity is observed: ALT levels from the rescued groups (drug + dendrimer) were 27% (methotrexate) and 36% (6-mercaptopurine) lower than those of animals treated with the drug alone.",16026011,Reduction of drug toxicity using dendrimers based on melamine.,1,1

"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is currently the most life-threatening congenital anomaly the major finding of which is lung hypoplasia. Lung hypoplasia pathophysiology involves early developmental molecular insult in branching morphogenesis and a late mechanical insult by abdominal herniation in maturation and differentiation processes. Since early determinants of lung hypoplasia might appear as promising targets for prenatal therapy, proteomics analysis of normal and nitrofen-induced hypoplastic lungs was performed at 17.5 days after conception. The major differentially expressed protein was identified by mass spectrometry as myosin light chain 1a (MLC1a). Embryonic essential MLC1a and regulatory myosin light chain 2 (MLC2) were characterized throughout normal and abnormal lung development by immunohistochemistry and Western blot. Disruption of MLC1a expression was assessed in normal lung explant cultures by antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Since early stages of normal lung development, MLC1a was expressed in vascular smooth muscle (VSM) cells of pulmonary artery, and MLC2 was present in parabronchial smooth muscle and VSM cells of pulmonary vessels. In addition, early smooth muscle differentiation delay was observed by immunohistochemistry of alpha-smooth muscle actin and transforming growth factor-beta1. Disruption of MLC1a expression during normal pulmonary development led to significant growth and branching impairment, suggesting a role in branching morphogenesis. Both MLC1a and MLC2 were absent from hypoplastic fetal lungs during pseudoglandular stage of lung development, whereas their expression partially recovered by prenatal treatment with vitamin A. Thus, a deficiency in contractile proteins MLC1a and MLC2 might have a role among the early molecular determinants of lung hypoplasia in the rat model of nitrofen-induced CDH.",17541012,Embryonic essential myosin light chain regulates fetal lung development in rats.,1,1

"Dose-finding designs estimate the dose level of a drug based on observed adverse events. Relatedness of the adverse event to the drug has been generally ignored in all proposed design methodologies. These designs assume that the adverse events observed during a trial are definitely related to the drug, which can lead to flawed dose-level estimation. We incorporate adverse event relatedness into the so-called continual reassessment method. Adverse events that have 'doubtful' or 'possible' relationships to the drug are modelled using a two-parameter logistic model with an additive probability mass. Adverse events 'probably' or 'definitely' related to the drug are modelled using a cumulative logistic model. To search for the maximum tolerated dose, we use the maximum estimated toxicity probability of these two adverse event relatedness categories. We conduct a simulation study that illustrates the characteristics of the design under various scenarios.

It opens up further research pathways into continual reassessment design methodologies.",24122859,Incorporating adverse event relatedness into dose-finding clinical trial designs.,0,1
"Increased, often inappropriate, drug exposure, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, reduced homeostatic reserve and frailty increase the risk of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the older population, thereby imposing a significant public health burden. Predicting and diagnosing ADRs in old age presents significant challenges for the clinician, even when specific risk scoring systems are available. The picture is further compounded by the potential adverse impact of several drugs on more 'global' health indicators, for example, physical function and independence, and the fragmentation of care (e.g., increased number of treating doctors and care transitions) experienced by older patients during their clinical journey. The current knowledge of drug safety in old age is also curtailed by the lack of efficacy and safety data from pre-marketing studies. Moreover, little consideration is given to individual patients' experiences and reporting of specific ADRs, particularly in the presence of cognitive impairment. Pending additional data on these issues, the close review and monitoring of individual patients' drug prescribing, clinical status and biochemical parameters remain essential to predict and detect ADRs in old age. Recently developed strategies, for example, medication reconciliation and trigger tool methodology, have the potential for ADRs risk mitigation in this population.

"Drugs and environmental chemicals can adversely alter the development of the fetus at critical periods during pregnancy, resulting in death, or in structural and functional birth defects in the surviving offspring. This process of teratogenesis may not be evident until a decade or more after birth. Postnatal functional abnormalities include deficits in brain function, a variety of metabolic diseases, and cancer. Due to the high degree of fetal cellular division and differentiation, and to differences from the adult in many biochemical pathways, the fetus is highly susceptible to teratogens, typically at low exposure levels that do not harm the mother. Insights into the mechanisms of teratogenesis come primarily from animal models and in vitro systems, and involve either receptor-mediated or reactive intermediate-mediated processes. Receptor-mediated mechanisms involving the reversible binding of xenobiotic substrates to a specific receptor are exemplified herein by the interaction of the environmental chemical 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or ""dioxin"") with the cytosolic aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR), which translocates to the nucleus and, in association with other proteins, binds to AH-responsive elements (AHREs) in numerous genes, initiating changes in gene transcription that can perturb development. Alternatively, many xenobiotics are bioactivated by fetal enzymes like the cytochromes P450 (CYPs) and prostaglandin H synthases (PHSs) to highly unstable electrophilic or free radical reactive intermediates. Electrophilic reactive intermediates can covalently (irreversibly) bind to and alter the function of essential cellular macromolecules (proteins, DNA), causing developmental anomalies. Free radical reactive intermediates can enhance the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), resulting in oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules and/or altered signal transduction. The teratogenicity of reactive intermediates is determined to a large extent by the balance among embryonic and fetal pathways of xenobiotic bioactivation, detoxification of the xenobiotic reactive intermediate, detoxification of ROS, and repair of oxidative macromolecular damage.",20020262,Receptor- and reactive intermediate-mediated mechanisms of teratogenesis.,1,1
"Striking QT prolongation and the morphologically distinctive ventricular tachycardia torsades de pointes can occur in up to 5% of patients treated with certain antiarrhythmic drugs. This adverse drug reaction also occurs, albeit far less frequently, during therapy with a range of drugs not used for cardiovascular indications; examples include certain antibiotics, antipsychotics and antihistamines. The common mechanism for drug-induced torsades de pointes is inhibition of a specific repolarizing potassium current, I(Kr). The key question facing clinicians, regulators and those who develop drugs is why torsades de pointes only occurs in some patients exposed to I(Kr) block. This paper reviews the clinical, cellular, molecular and genetic features of the arrhythmia that may provide an answer to this question and proposes future studies in this area.",18552874,Cellular basis of drug-induced torsades de pointes.,1,1
"The International Conference on Harmonization considers older people a 'special population', as they differ from younger adults in terms of comorbidity, polypharmacy, pharmacokinetics and greater vulnerability to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Medical practice is often based on single disease guidelines derived from clinical trials that have not included frail older people or those with multiple morbidities. This presents a challenge caring for older people, as drug doses in trials may not be achievable in real world patients and risks of ADRs are underestimated in clinical trial populations. The majority of ADRs in older people are Type A, potentially avoidable and associated with commonly prescribed medications. Several ADRs are particularly associated with major adverse consequences in the elderly and their reduction is therefore a clinical priority. Falls are strongly associated with benzodiazepines, neuroleptics, antidepressants and antihypertensives. There is good evidence for medication review as part of a multifactorial intervention to reduce falls risk in community dwelling elderly. Multiple medications also contribute to delirium, another multifactorial syndrome resulting in excess mortality particularly in frail older people. Clostridium difficile associated with use of broad spectrum antibiotics mainly affects frail older people and results in prolonged hospital stay with substantial morbidity and mortality. Antipsychotics increase the risk of stroke by more than three-fold in patients with dementia. Inappropriate prescribing can be reduced by adherence to prescribing guidelines, suitable monitoring and regular medication review. Given the heterogeneity within the older population, providing individualized care is pivotal to preventing ADRs. ",25619317,Adverse drug reactions in special populations - the elderly.,0,1

"Congenital anomalies that are diagnosed in at least 120,000 US infants every year are the leading cause of infant death and contribute to disability and pediatric hospitalizations. Several large-scale epidemiologic studies have provided substantial evidence of an association between congenital anomalies and cancer risk in children, suggesting potential underlying cancer-predisposing conditions and the involvement of developmental genetic pathways. Electronic medical records from 1,107 pediatric, adolescent, and young adult oncology patients were reviewed. The observed number (O) of congenital anomalies among children with a specific pediatric cancer subtype was compared to the expected number (E) of anomalies based on the frequency of congenital anomalies in the entire study population. The O/E ratios were tested for significance using Fisher's exact test. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare overall and neurological malignancy survival rates following tumor diagnosis. Thirteen percent of patients had a congenital anomaly diagnosis prior to their cancer diagnosis. When stratified by congenital anomaly subtype, there was an excess of neurological anomalies among children with central nervous system tumors (O/E = 1.56, 95%CI 1.13-2.09).

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a recognised unintentional form of iatrogenic harm, which commonly occur in older adults who have high levels of multi-morbidity and associated polypharmacy. Previous studies estimate that at least one in 10 hospitalised older patients will experience an ADR. While recent research indicates that this could be as high as 39% in hospitalised multi-morbid, older adults, up to two-thirds of these ADRs can be considered preventable and therefore potentially avoidable. In addition to increasing patient morbidity and contributing to avoidable mortality, there is an associated cost implication with ADR occurrence. This commentary summarises current mainstream research in terms of ADR detection, prediction and prevention in multi-morbid older patients. At present, the biggest barrier to understanding and comparing ADRs in the literature is the large heterogeneity that exists in the population and study methods. Furthermore, there is the lack of standardised universally accepted methodology for ADR prediction, detection, causality assessment and subsequent prevention in older people. Standard available methods of ADR prediction applied to a heterogeneous multi-morbid population are generally unsatisfactory. Without an instrument that consistently and reliably predicts ADR risk in a reproducible manner, ADR prevention in multi-morbid older patients is challenging. Further attention should be focused on the culprit drugs that commonly lead to major ADRs in older multi-morbid hospitalised patients with polypharmacy. Risk associated with particular drug classes may possibly predict ADR occurrence better than patient characteristics alone. Current research is examining this drug class focus for ADR prevention in multi-morbid older people.",30299453,Detection and prevention of adverse drug reactions in multi-morbid older patients.,0,1

Prescribed medications or medical therapies that can affect the CNS include immunosuppressants, antiepileptics, nitrous oxide, and total parenteral nutrition. The CNS complications of these drugs include neurovascular complications, encephalopathy, atrophy, infection, changes in the corpus callosum, and other miscellaneous changes. Imaging abnormalities indicative of these complications can be appreciated at both magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and computed tomography (CT). It is critical for radiologists to recognize complications related to drugs of abuse as well as iatrogenic effects of various medications. Therefore, diagnostic imaging modalities such as MR imaging and CT can play a pivotal role in the recognition and timely management of drug-related complications in the CNS.",22582355,Your brain on drugs: imaging of drug-related changes in the central nervous system.,1,1

"To study relevant risk factors of Shenmai injection induced adverse reactions by using Logistic model and ROC curve, and made the prediction for the occurrence of relevant adverse reactions/events. Case data of patients treated with Shenmai injection were collected by using the prospective, multi-center, large-sample, nested-case control method, in order to analyze the risk factors of Shenmai injection-induced adverse reactions/events, establish the logistic model and draw the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for risk factors. During the study, 7632 patients (including 3 477 males and 4 155 females) were included, and eight of them suffered adverse reactions/events. Based on a multi-factor Logistic model analysis, the age (> or = 50 years) (OR = 5.061, 95% CI: 2.197-7.924; P = 0.001), the total number of medication days (OR = -1.020, 95% CI: -l.652 - 0.388; P = 0.002) and the single dose (OR = 0.245, 95% CI: 0.127-0.364; P = 0.000) were significant independent risk factors for Shenmai injection-induced adverse reactions/events. According to the results, ROC curves were drawn with age (> or = 50 years), the total number of days of inedication and single dose; The area under ROC curves the joint predictor (0.9753, 95% CI: 0.9443-1.000, P < 0.005) was larger than that of the other three single indexes, with a higher risk prediction value.

"Congenital anomalies (CAs) represent one of the main cause of foetal death, infant mortality and morbidity, and long-term disability. CAs have been object of systematic registration activity for a long-time in many geographical areas in Europe and worldwide. CAs are often associated with disabilities of different types and severity, including the developed Countries worldwide. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), each year approximately 3,2 million of children worldwide are born with a CA and approximately 300,000 newborns with a diagnosis of birth defect die within the first 28 days of life. In Europe, CAs are the leading cause of perinatal mortality: the European Surveillance of Congenital Anomalies (EUROC AT) network estimated a perinatal mortality associated with CAs of 9.2 per 10,000 births in 2008-2012. In Italy, the Ministry of Health estimates that, on the average of 500,000 births each year, about 25,000 present at least one CA. Moreover, approximately 25% of infant mortality is due to CAs and about 50% of infant mortality is attributable to perinatal morbidity, almost always of prenatal origin. Regarding long-term survival, a recent population study conducted between 1985 and 2003 in the UK estimated a 20.5-year survival of 85.5% of children born with at least one CA. According to the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 3.3% of live births in the United States have a severe birth defect. Since CAs represent a significant public health issue, an effective primary prevention strategy should be a priority for public policies and healthcare system. Regarding aetiology, although in many cases the cause is still unknown, it has been hypothesized that CAs may be developed during the first trimester of pregnancy as a result of hereditary polygenic defects or of a gene-environment interaction. The aetiology is predominantly multifactorial, caused by complex interactions between genes and environment, which modify the normal embryo-foetal development, especially during the organogenesis phase. In particular, environmental factors (e.g., chemical toxicants, infection agents, maternal disease, and exogenous factors) can have preconceptional mutagenic action, postconceptional teratogenic effects, periconceptional endocrine disruption or epigenetic action. Regarding genetic causes, there are genetic chromosomal aberrations or dysgeneses. Furthermore, socioeconomic factors affect reproductive health by differentiating the exposure to the other risk factors as well as the access to prevention measures. In recent years, the importance of the environment as a major factor of reproductive risk has been highlighted. An individual may be exposed to pollutants present in the workplace and the population may be exposed to multiple sources of environmental contamination of water, soil, and air matrices. Pregnant women and the developing foetus are particularly sensitive to the effects of environmental exposure.",30066535,Environmental and individual exposure and the risk of congenital anomalies: a review of recent epidemiological evidence.,1,0
"Low birth weight is a known comorbidity of congenital heart disease (CHD). This study examines the relationship between CHD and birth weight of singletons, while attempting to remove factors that influence birth weight, and assesses the impact of CHD on growth in later life. The main objective is to study the relationship between birthweight and CHD. This is a cross-sectional study of 141 samples, covering all patients who were referred to the Paediatric Echocardiography Lab at Ahmed Gasim Cardiac Centre between September and October 2016. Infants with genetic syndromes or other major extracardiac abnormalities were excluded. The findings of this study clearly demonstrate that infants with CHD are more likely to be of low birth weight than the general Sudanese population, by a factor of 2.6. Of the sample, 31.9% were born with low or very low birthweight. The mean birth weight of the cases was 2.59 kg, which is 17.3% and 542.4 g less than the national average. CHD that cause a decrement in birth weight in a descending order of severity were atrial septal defect (-721 g/23%), patent ductus arteriosus (-669 g/21%), ventricular septal defect (-610 g/19%), pulmonary stenosis (-548 g/13%) and tetralogy of Fallot (248 g/8%). Pre/postnatal growth impairment is a common feature among children with CHD. No statistically significant relationship was found between the degree of birth weight/weight to age decrement and the specific type of hemodynamic disturbance. Our results are comparable to other studies that have been undertaken. However, Sudanese patients display larger birthweight deficits than other populations.",29545665,"The relationship between birth weight and congenital heart disease at Ahmed Gasim Cardiac Centre, Bahri, Sudan.",1,0

"Drug-induced prolongation of the QT interval is having a significant impact on the ability of the pharmaceutical industry to develop new drugs. The development implications for a compound causing a significant effect in the 'Thorough QT/QTc Study' -- as defined in the clinical regulatory guidance (ICH E14) -- are substantial. In view of this, and the fact that QT interval prolongation is linked to direct inhibition of the hERG channel, in the early stages of drug discovery the focus is on testing for and screening out hERG activity. This has led to understanding of how to produce low potency hERG blockers whilst retaining desirable properties. Despite this, a number of factors mean that when an integrated risk assessment is generated towards the end of the discovery phase (by conducting at least an in vivo QT assessment) a QT interval prolongation risk is still often apparent; inhibition of hERG channel trafficking and partitioning into cardiac tissue are just two confounding factors. However, emerging information suggests that hERG safety margins have high predictive value and that when hERG and in vivo non-clinical data are combined, their predictive value to man, whilst not perfect, is >80%. Although understanding the anomalies is important and is being addressed, of greater importance is developing a better understanding of TdP, with the aim of being able to predict TdP rather than using an imperfect surrogate marker (QT interval prolongation). Without an understanding of how to predict TdP risk, high-benefit drugs for serious indications may never be marketed.",18500356,Strategies to reduce the risk of drug-induced QT interval prolongation: a pharmaceutical company perspective.,1,1

"Isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia is often a sporadic event with a low recurrence risk. However, underlying genetic etiologies, such as chromosome anomalies or single gene disorders, are identified in a small number of individuals. We describe two fetuses with a unique pattern of multiple congenital anomalies, including diaphragmatic hernia, short bowel and asplenia, born to first-cousin parents. Whole exome sequencing showed that both were homozygous for a missense variant, c.950A>C, predicting p.Asp317Ala, in the H.20-Like Homeobox 1 (HLX1) gene. HLX is a homeobox transcription factor gene which is relatively conserved across species. Hlx homozygous null mice have a short bowel and reduced muscle cells in the diaphragm, closely resembling the anomalies in the two fetuses and we therefore suggest that the HLX mutation in this family could explain the fetal findings.",28898547,"HLX is a candidate gene for a pattern of anomalies associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, short bowel, and asplenia.",0,0

"We aimed to assess prevalence, birth outcome, associated anomalies and prenatal diagnosis of congenital clubfoot in Europe using data from the EUROCAT network, and to validate the recording of congenital clubfoot as a major congenital anomaly by EUROCAT registries. Cases of congenital clubfoot were included from 18 EUROCAT registries covering more than 4.8 million births in 1995-2011. Cases without chromosomal anomalies born during 2005-2009, were randomly selected for validation using a questionnaire on diagnostic details and treatment. There was 5,458 congenital clubfoot cases of which 5,056 (93%) were liveborn infants. Total prevalence of congenital clubfoot was 1.13 per 1,000 births (95% CI 1.10-1.16). Prevalence of congenital clubfoot without chromosomal anomaly was 1.08 per 1,000 births (95% CI 1.05-1.11) and prevalence of isolated congenital clubfoot was 0.92 per 1,000 births (95% CI 0.90-0.95), both with decreasing trends over time and large variations in prevalence by registry. The majority of cases were isolated congenital clubfoot (82%) and 11% had associated major congenital anomalies. Prenatal detection rate of isolated congenital clubfoot was 22% and increased over time. Among 301 validated congenital clubfoot cases, diagnosis was confirmed for 286 (95%). In conclusion, this large population-based study found a decreasing trend of congenital clubfoot in Europe after 1999-2002, an increasing prenatal detection rate, and a high standard of coding of congenital clubfoot in EUROCAT.",30740879,Congenital clubfoot in Europe: A population-based study.,1,0

"We recently redefined phosphoglucomutase-1 deficiency not only as an enzyme defect, involved in normal glycogen metabolism, but also an inborn error of protein glycosylation. Phosphoglucomutase-1 is a key enzyme in glycolysis and glycogenesis by catalyzing in the bidirectional transfer of phosphate from position 1 to 6 on glucose. Glucose-1-P and UDP-glucose are closely linked to galactose metabolism. Normal PGM1 activity is important for effective glycolysis during fasting. Activated glucose and galactose are essential for normal protein glycosylation. The complex defect involving abnormal concentrations of activated sugars leads to hypoglycemia and two major phenotypic presentations, one with primary muscle involvement and the other with severe multisystem disease. The multisystem phenotype includes growth delay and malformations, like cleft palate or uvula, and liver, endocrine and heart function with possible cardiomyopathy. The patients have normal intelligence. Decreased transferrin galactosylation is a characteristic finding on mass spectrometry. Previous in vitro studies in patient fibroblasts showed an improvement of glycosylation on galactose supplements. Four patients with PGM1 deficiency have been trialed on d-galactose (compassionate use), and showed improvement of serum transferrin hypoglycosylation. There was a parallel improvement of liver function, endocrine abnormalities and a decrease in the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. No side effects have been observed. Galactose supplementation didn't seem to resolve all clinical symptoms. Adding complex carbohydrates showed an additional clinical amelioration. Based on the available clinical data we suggest to consider the use of 0.5-1g/kg/day d-galactose and maximum 50 g/day oral galactose therapy in PGM1-CDG. The existing data on galactose therapy have to be viewed as preliminary observations.

"Beals syndrome is an autosomal-dominant connective tissue disorder, characterized by multiple flexion contractures, arachnodactyly, severe kyphoscoliosis, crumpled ear, and muscular hypoplasia. It has similarities to Marfan syndrome (MFS) in many respects. It has much fewer incidences of eye and heart anomalies compared with MFS. Beals syndrome is caused by a mutation in the fibrillin-2 gene (FBN2) in 5q23; MFS is caused by mutations in fibrillin-1. With time, there is spontaneous improvement in joint contractures, but kyphosis tends to be progressive. The neonatal form results from new mutations and tends to be severe. Prenatal molecular diagnosis is possible. Ultrasound could be used to demonstrate hypokinesia and joint contractures in presumptive cases. We present a case of a patient with Beals syndrome who presented to the emergency department with pneumonia and was found to have narrowing of the foramen magnum, with partial fusion of C2-C3 vertebral bodies.

"Orofacial clefts are among the most common types of birth defects, but their clinical presentation has not been well described in a geographically diverse US population. To describe the birth prevalence and phenotype of nonsyndromic clefts, we used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a multi-site, population-based, case-control study aimed at identifying genetic and environmental risk factors for birth defects. Included in the study were infants born during 1997-2004 with a cleft lip (CL), cleft lip with cleft palate (CLP), or cleft palate (CP). Infants with clefts associated with recognized single-gene disorders, chromosome abnormalities, holoprosencephaly, or amniotic band sequence were excluded. A total of 3,344 infants with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts were identified, including 751 with CL, 1,399 with CLP, and 1,194 with CP, giving birth prevalence estimates of 0.3, 0.5, and 0.4/1,000 live births, respectively. Among infants with CLP where cleft laterality was specified, about twice as many had unilateral vs. bilateral involvement, while for CL there were over 10 times as many with unilateral versus bilateral involvement. Involvement was most often left-sided. About one-quarter of infants with CP had Pierre Robin sequence. Over 80% of infants had an isolated orofacial cleft. Among infants with CL or CLP, heart, limb, and other musculoskeletal defects were most commonly observed, while heart, limb, and central nervous system defects were most common among infants with CP.

"<b>Objective:</b> To evaluate the efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in a real-world clinical practice in Chinese patients with multiple myeloma (MM). <b>Methods:</b> It was a prospective, multi-center, observational study. A total of 165 consecutive patients with MM treated with lenalidomide-based regimens were enrolled in 12 hospitals from June 2013 to November 2015. Relevant information was recorded, such as baseline clinical data, cytogenetic abnormalities, treatment regimens, and duration of treatment, safety, and survival. <b>Results:</b> (1)There were 126 relapsed and refractory MM (RRMM) patients, 25 newly diagnosed patients and 19 maintenance patients. The evaluable RRMM patients accounted for 120 cases, among which 74 cases(61.7%) reached the partial response (PR) or above, and a very good partial response (VGPR) in 16 patients (13.3%), a complete response (CR) in 14 cases (11.7%), a strictly complete response (sCR) in 4 cases (3.3%). Thus, a VGPR or above in 34 patients accounted for 28.3%. (2)The median follow-up was 13 months, the median time to progression 12 months. The median survival after receiving lenalidomide was 19 months, and the median overall survival (OS) was 62 months. (3) The univariate analysis in 120 RRMM patients suggested that prognostic factors for significant improvement in PFS included normal karyotype, international staging system (ISS) Ⅰ-Ⅱ, t(4; 14) negative (detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization), non-bortezomib resistance and response to previous regimens. As to OS, non-bortezomib resistance, response to previous regimens and non-primary refractoriness were positive factors. Multivariate analysis showed that the response to previous regimens (PR or better) was an independent good prognostic factor for progress-free survival(PFS), non-bortezomib resistance and non-primary refractoriness for OS. (4) Grade 3 or 4 adverse events that occurred in more than 10% of all enrolled patients were neutropenia (12.7%), leukocytosis(11.5%) and thrombocytopenia (12.7%). Owing to intolerance of toxic side effects, 7 cases withdrew lenalidomide. <b>Conclusions:</b> No matter what combination, regimens containing lenalidomide are effective to RRMM patients with overall response rate 61.7%, a time to progression 12 months and an overall survival 62 months.The toxicity is quite tolerable and manageable. In addition, the response to previous treatment (reached PR or above) is the independent good prognostic factor for PFS, non-bortezomib resistance and non-primary refractoriness for OS. <b>Clinical trail registration:</b> Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT01947309.",28693058,[A prospective multi-center trial of non-interventional and observational study of lenalidomide in Chinese patients with multiple myeloma].,1,1

"Limited data exist on the burden of serious adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in sub-Saharan Africa, which has high HIV and tuberculosis prevalence. We determined the proportion of adult admissions attributable to ADRs at 4 hospitals in South Africa. We characterized drugs implicated in, risk factors for, and the preventability of ADR-related admissions.We prospectively followed patients admitted to 4 hospitals' medical wards over sequential 30-day periods in 2013 and identified suspected ADRs with the aid of a trigger tool. A multidisciplinary team performed causality, preventability, and severity assessment using published criteria. We categorized an admission as ADR-related if the ADR was the primary reason for admission.There were 1951 admissions involving 1904 patients: median age was 50 years (interquartile range 34-65), 1057 of 1904 (56%) were female, 559 of 1904 (29%) were HIV-infected, and 183 of 1904 (10%) were on antituberculosis therapy (ATT). There were 164 of 1951 (8.4%) ADR-related admissions. After adjustment for age and ATT, ADR-related admission was independently associated (P ≤ 0.02) with female sex (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.51, 95% confidence interval [95% CI] 1.06-2.14), increasing drug count (aOR 1.14 per additional drug, 95% CI 1.09-1.20), increasing comorbidity score (aOR 1.23 per additional point, 95% CI 1.07-1.41), and use of antiretroviral therapy (ART) if HIV-infected (aOR 1.92 compared with HIV-negative/unknown, 95% CI 1.17-3.14).

"Artificial neural networks are the main tools for data mining and were inspired by the human brain and nervous system. Studies have demonstrated their usefulness in medicine. However, no studies have used artificial neural networks for the prediction of adverse drug reactions. We aimed to validate the usefulness of artificial neural networks for the prediction of adverse drug reactions and focused on vancomycin -induced nephrotoxicity. For constructing an artificial neural network, a multilayer perceptron algorithm was employed. A 10-fold cross validation method was adopted for evaluating the resultant artificial neural network. In total, 1141 patients who received vancomycin at Hokkaido University Hospital from November 2011 to February 2019 were enrolled. Among these patients, 179 (15.7%) developed vancomycin -induced nephrotoxicity. The top three risk factors of vancomycin -induced nephrotoxicity which are relatively important in the artificial neural networks were average vancomycin trough concentration ≥ 13.0 mg/L and concomitant use of piperacillin-tazobactam and vasopressor drugs. The predictive accuracy of the artificial neural network was 86.3% and that of the multiple logistic regression model (conventional statistical method) was 85.1%. Moreover, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the artificial neural network was 0.83. In the 10-fold cross-validation, the accuracy obtained was 86.0% and AUROC was 0.82.

"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a serious birth defect that accounts for 8% of all major birth anomalies. Approximately 40% of cases occur in association with other anomalies. As sporadic complex CDH likely has a significant impact on reproductive fitness, we hypothesized that de novo variants would account for the etiology in a significant fraction of cases. We performed exome sequencing in 39 CDH trios and compared the frequency of de novo variants with 787 unaffected controls from the Simons Simplex Collection. We found no significant difference in overall frequency of de novo variants between cases and controls. However, among genes that are highly expressed during diaphragm development, there was a significant burden of likely gene disrupting (LGD) and predicted deleterious missense variants in cases (fold enrichment = 3.2, P-value = 0.003), and these genes are more likely to be haploinsufficient (P-value = 0.01) than the ones with benign missense or synonymous de novo variants in cases. After accounting for the frequency of de novo variants in the control population, we estimate that 15% of sporadic complex CDH patients are attributable to de novo LGD or deleterious missense variants. We identified several genes with predicted deleterious de novo variants that fall into common categories of genes related to transcription factors and cell migration that we believe are related to the pathogenesis of CDH. These data provide supportive evidence for novel genes in the pathogenesis of CDH associated with other anomalies and suggest that de novo variants play a significant role in complex CDH cases.

Children were identified using ICD-9 and ICD-10 billing codes. Primary measures included diagnosis of SNHL, ophthalmologic diagnoses, and referral source. <b>Results:</b> Two hundred and sixty-nine patients with SNHL met inclusion criteria. One hundred and thirty-one (48.5%) of these patients had an ophthalmic abnormality. When evaluating referral source, patients referred by a pediatrician following failed vision screen or visual complaint were more likely to have an ophthalmologic finding (61%, n = 147) when compared to referral by an otolaryngologist following diagnosis of SNHL (9.6%, n = 73). Seventeen of the 131 (13%) patients with at least one ophthalmic abnormality had an abnormality that was deemed unlikely to be detected by routine screening. <b>Conclusion:</b> Our study agreed with previously published works that there is a high rate of ophthalmic abnormalities in patients with SNHL. Evaluation of referral source for ophthalmology evaluation suggests that routine referral by otolaryngologists in patients with SNHL may not be an efficient means of identifying patients with treatable ophthalmic disease.

"Case-control studies of antenatal drug exposure and birth defects often rely on maternal recall of drug use in pregnancy. Differential recall among mothers of cases and controls can lead to information bias (""maternal recall bias""), and the opportunity for such bias increases as ascertainment of drug exposure diminishes. The effect of questionnaire design on the ascertainment of drug use in pregnancy was examined in two studies. In a pilot interview study of 532 women in obstetric/gynecologic practices, information on drug use in the past year was obtained by means of three questions asked in sequence: The first question was open-ended, the second asked about drug use for selected indications, and the third asked about use of specifically named drugs. Among obstetric patients who reported use of any of five drugs, less than 50% did so in response to the open-ended question, and approximately 20-40% reported use only when the specific drug name was asked. In a case-control Birth Defects Study of 5,435 mothers of malformed children, information on drug use in pregnancy was obtained by asking questions in sequence about indications and specifically named drugs. Among the women who reported use of any of 11 drugs, 6-40% did so only when asked about the specific drug by name.

"The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) consists of the mandibular condyle and the articular eminence of the temporal bone. The morphological development of the TMJ during prenatal life lags behind other joints in terms of both the timing of its appearance and its progress. At birth, the joint is still largely underdeveloped. There are many causes of the various growth disturbances and abnormalities of the mandibular condyle and related structures. Growth disturbances in the development of the mandibular condyle may occur in utero late in the first trimester and may result in disorders such as aplasia or hypoplasia of the mandibular condyle. Meanwhile, hyperplasia of the mandibular condyle is not visible at birth and seems to be gradually acquired during growth. In the present review article, the congenital abnormalities of the mandibular condyle are classified morphologically into three major groups and two subgroups from a clinical standpoint: (1) hypoplasia or aplasia of the mandibular condyle, including (i) primary condylar aplasia and hypoplasia, (ii) secondary condylar hypoplasia; (2) hyperplasia; and (3) bifidity.

"This study assessed white matter microstructural integrity and behavioral correlates for children with severe congenital hypothyroidism (CH) who were identified and treated early following newborn screening. Eighteen children with severe CH and 21 healthy controls underwent a battery of behavioral measures of hearing, language and communication, along with diffusion MR imaging. Tract-based spatial statistics were performed on standard diffusion parameters of fractional anisotropy and diffusivity metrics. Microscopic diffusion anisotropy mapping based on the Spherical Mean Technique was also used to evaluate biologically specific metrics. Compared with age-matched controls, children with severe CH had poorer hearing and communication skills, albeit generally within normal limits. Children with severe CH had fractional anisotropy that was significantly lower in the cerebellum, bilateral thalami and right temporal lobe, and radial diffusivity that was significantly higher in the cerebellum and bilateral thalami. Microscopic fractional anisotropy and intra-neurite volume fraction were also significantly decreased, and transverse microscopic diffusivity was significantly increased, in the CH group in areas including the cerebellum, thalamus, occipital lobe, and corpus callosum, and in the white matter adjacent to sensorimotor cortex, particularly in the left hemisphere. Significant and widespread correlations were observed between behavioral measures and measures of white matter microstructural integrity in children with CH.

"The programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor checkpoint inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab represent an important therapeutic advance in the treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL). Clinical trials have shown substantial therapeutic activity and an acceptable safety profile in heavily pretreated patients, resulting in U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval of nivolumab for the treatment of cHL that has relapsed or progressed after either autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (auto-HCT) and brentuximab vedotin treatment or three or more lines of systemic therapy (including auto-HCT), and of pembrolizumab for adult or pediatric patients with refractory cHL or cHL that has relapsed after three or more prior therapies. Mechanistically, anti-PD-1 therapy prevents inhibitory signaling through PD-1 receptors on T cells, thereby releasing a 'block' to antitumor T-cell responses. However, this disinhibition can also lead to inappropriate T-cell activation and responses against healthy tissues, resulting in immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) that affect a number of organ systems. The skin, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and endocrine systems are most commonly involved, typically resulting in rash, colitis, abnormal liver enzyme levels, and thyroiditis, respectively. Notably, pneumonitis is a potentially fatal complication of checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy. Hematologic oncologists who treat cHL with PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitors should monitor patients for IMAEs, as early recognition and treatment can rapidly reduce morbidity and mortality. This review focuses on IMAEs during the treatment of relapsed or refractory cHL with nivolumab and pembrolizumab. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: This article highlights the importance of monitoring for immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs) in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) who receive anti-programmed death-1 (anti-PD-1) therapy, with particular attention given to the recognition and management of such events. The risk of individual IMAEs differs between patients with HL and those with solid tumors, as prior treatments may predispose certain organ systems to specific IMAEs. Accurate and prompt diagnosis of IMAEs is essential for optimal management, allowing PD-1 inhibitor therapy to be restarted in order to maintain disease control. Potential difficulties, such as distinguishing disease progression from pneumonitis, or colitis from diarrhea, are highlighted to raise clinical awareness.",30082490,Strategies for Recognizing and Managing Immune-Mediated Adverse Events in the Treatment of Hodgkin Lymphoma with Checkpoint Inhibitors.,0,0
"Congenital pancreatic hypoplasia is a rare cause of neonatal diabetes. We report on a series of three patients with pancreatic agenesis and congenital heart defects. All had abdominal scan evidence of pancreatic agenesis. In addition, Patient 1 had a ventricular septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary artery stenosis; Patient 2 had a truncus arteriosus and Patient 3 had tetralogy of Fallot. Two of the three patients have developmental delay. All three patients were isolated cases within the family. Investigations included sequencing of GCK, ABCC8, IPF1, NEUROD1, PTF1A, HNF1B, INS, ISL1, NGN3, HHEX, G6PC2, TCF7L2, SOX4, FOXP3 (Patients 1 and 2), GATA4 and KCNJ11 genes (all three patients), but no mutations were found. Genetic investigation to exclude paternal UPD 6, methylation aberrations and duplications of 6q24 was also negative in all three. 22q11 deletion was excluded in all three patients.

"The efficacy of chemotherapy is often limited by side effects in normal tissues. This is exemplified by cisplatin, a widely used anti-cancer drug that may induce serious toxicity in normal tissues and organs including the kidneys. Decades of research have delineated multiple signaling pathways that lead to kidney cell injury and death during cisplatin treatment. However, the same signaling pathways may also be activated in cancer cells and be responsible for the chemotherapeutic effects of cisplatin in tumors and, as a result, blockade of these pathways is expected to reduce the side effects as well as the anti-cancer efficacy. Thus, to effectively curtail the side effects, it is imperative to elucidate and target the cell killing mechanisms that are specific to normal (and not cancer) tissues. Our recent work identified protein kinase C δ (PKCδ) as a new and critical mediator of cisplatin-induced kidney cell injury and death. Importantly, inhibition of PKCδ enhanced the chemotherapeutic effects of cisplatin in several tumor models while alleviating the side effect in kidneys, opening a new avenue for normal tissue protection during chemotherapy.",22403741,Curtailing side effects in chemotherapy: a tale of PKCδ in cisplatin treatment.,0,1

Objective This study aimed to identify DRPs and their causes in a Turkish hospital. Setting Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Teaching and Research Hospital, Internal Medicine Ward, Istanbul, Turkey. Method Cross-sectional study included a total of 100 patients. Patient demographics, medications, and history were evaluated. Data regarding recent medications were analyzed by two clinical pharmacists and an Internal Medicine physician. The DRPs were identified via V7.0 PCNE classification. Lexicomp<sup>®</sup> was used to assess the drug-drug interactions. UpToDate<sup>®</sup> recommendations and national guidelines were applied in the assessment of compliance with approved medication procedures. Main outcome measures Number and causes of the potential DRPs. Results At least one potential DRP was seen in 80% of the patients and 163 potential DRPs were identified (average = 1.6 DRPs/patient). The most common causes of DRPs were errors in drug selection (44.78%), dose selection (27.61%) and medication procedures (21.47%). There were significant correlations (p < 0.05) between DRPs and age (r = 0.4), number of drugs used (r = 0.32), duration of hospitalization (r = 0.25), renal impairment (r = - 0.34) and inflammation (r = 0.31).

"An obstetrical ultrasound examination provides invaluable information regarding the fetus. Until the mid-1980s, ultrasound in the first trimester was limited to localization of the pregnancy, establishing viability, and accurate dating. With the advent of high-resolution ultrasound and transvaginal scanning, a significant amount of information about the fetus can be gained and provided to the patient at a very early stage in gestation. This article provides an overview of the role of first trimester (11-13 + 6 weeks' gestation) ultrasound in screening and diagnosis of fetal anomalies. The first trimester is an ideal time for screening for aneuploidy, primarily due to the advantages that nuchal translucency (NT) measurement provides. NT measurement is also useful in establishing the risk of congenital cardiac disorders and a number of genetic and non-genetic syndromes. Significant NT thickening is associated with an increase in perinatal morbidity and mortality. Potential mechanisms resulting in increased NT are discussed. A number of new ultrasound markers for fetal aneuploidy have been investigated over the past several years, some of which appear to improve the screening efficacy of early ultrasonography. The role of these is reviewed. A number of fetal anomalies can now be consistently diagnosed in the first trimester. Their appearance at this early gestational age is discussed as well. It is clear that, data obtained by first trimester ultrasound are useful in counseling expectant parents and in planning the appropriate follow-up.",17304542,First trimester ultrasonography in screening and detection of fetal anomalies.,0,0

"Half of the malformations in the ear, nose, and throat region affect the ear. Malformations of the external ear (pinna or auricle with external auditory canal [EAC]) are collectively termed microtia. Microtia is a congenital anomaly that ranges in severity from mild structural abnormalities to complete absence of the external ear (anotia). Microtia occurs more frequently in males (∼2 or 3:1), is predominantly unilateral (∼70-90%), and more often involves the right ear (∼60%). The reported prevalence varies geographically from 0.83 to 17.4 per 10,000 births. Microtia may be genetic (with family history, spontaneous mutations) or acquired. Malformations of the external ear can also involve the middle ear and/or inner ear. Microtia may be an isolated birth defect, but associated anomalies or syndromes are described in 20 to 60% of cases, depending on study design. These generally fit within the oculo-auriculo-vertebral spectrum; defects are located most frequently in the facial skeleton, facial soft tissues, heart, and vertebral column, or comprise a syndrome (e.g., Treacher Collins syndrome). Diagnostic investigation of microtia includes clinical examination, audiologic testing, genetic analysis and, especially in higher grade malformations with EAC deformities, computed tomography (CT) or cone-beam CT for the planning of surgery and rehabilitation procedures, including implantation of hearing aids.

"Cancer chemopreventive agents inhibit the formation of precursor lesions and/or the progression of these lesions to late stage disease. This approach to disease control has the potential to reduce the physical and financial costs of cancer in society. Several drugs that have been approved by the FDA for other diseases and have been extensively evaluated for their safety and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic characteristics have the potential to be repurposed for use as cancer chemopreventive agents. These agents often mechanistically inhibit signaling molecules that play key roles in the carcinogenic process. The safety profile of agents is a primary concern when considering the administration of drugs for chemoprevention, as the drugs will be given chronically to high-risk, asymptomatic individuals. To decrease drug toxicity while retaining efficacy, several approaches are currently being explored. In this short review, we describe studies that use preclinical in vivo models to assess efficacy of alternative drug dosing strategies and routes of drug administration on chemopreventive drug efficacy. In vivo drug dosing strategies that reduce toxicity while retaining efficacy will pave the way for future cancer prevention clinical trials.",31020311,Cancer Chemoprevention: Preclinical In Vivo Alternate Dosing Strategies to Reduce Drug Toxicities.,0,0

"With all of our present knowledge, high technology diagnostic equipment, electronic databases and other available supporting resources, detection of fetal syndromes is still a challenge for healthcare providers in prenatal as well as in the postnatal period. Prenatal diagnosis of fetal syndromes is not straightforward, and it is a difficult puzzle that needs to be assembled and solved. Detection of one anomaly should always raise a suspicion of the existence of more anomalies, and can be a trigger to investigate further and raise awareness of possible syndromes. Highly specialized software systems for three- and four-dimensional ultrasound (3D/4D US) enabled detailed depiction of fetal anatomy and assessment of the dynamics of fetal structural and functional development in real time. With recent advances in 3D/4D US technology, antenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies and syndromes shifted from the 2nd to the 1st trimester of pregnancy. It is questionable what can and should be done after the prenatal diagnosis of fetal syndrome. The 3D and 4D US techniques improved detection accuracy of fetal abnormalities and syndromes from early pregnancy onwards. It is not easy to make prenatal diagnosis of fetal syndromes, so tools which help like online integrated databases are needed to increase diagnostic precision. The aim of this paper is to present the possibilities of different US techniques in the detection of some fetal syndromes prenatally.",28493822,Diagnosis of fetal syndromes by three- and four-dimensional ultrasound: is there any improvement?,1,0

"During 2012, 13% of the deaths worldwide in children under the age of 28 days were due to congenital malformations. In Colombia, congenital malformations are the second leading cause of infant mortality. Objective: To determine the geographical distribution of extended perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia between 1999 and 2008. Materials and methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study. We revised all death certificates issued between 1999 and 2008. We defined perinatal mortality as fetal or non-fetal deaths within the first 28 days after delivery in children with body weight ≥500 grams, and congenital malformations according to ICD-10 diagnostic codes Q000 - Q999. The annual birth projection was used as the denominator. We defined high mortality areas due to congenital malformations as those in the 90th percentile. Results: We recorded 22,361 perinatal deaths due to congenital malformations. The following provinces exceeded the 90th perinatal mortality percentile: Antioquia, Caldas, Risaralda, Huila, Quindío, Bogotá, Valle del Cauca and Guainía. Among the municipalities, the highest perinatal mortality rates were found in Giraldo, Ciudad Bolívar, Riosucio, Liborina, Supía, Alejandría, Sopetrán, San Jerónimo, Santa Fe de Antioquia and Marmato (205.81 and 74.18 per 10.000 live births).The perinatal mortality rate due to malformations of the circulatory system was 28.1 per 10.000 live births, whereas the rates for central nervous system defects and chromosomal abnormalities were 13.7 and 7.0, respectively.",27869383,"[Geographic distribution of perinatal mortality due to congenital malformations in Colombia, 1999-2008: An analysis of vital statistics data].",1,0

"Multi-species conserved non-coding elements occur in the vertebrate genome and are clustered in the vicinity of developmentally regulated genes. Many are known to act as cis-regulators of transcription and may reside at long distances from the genes they regulate. However, the relationship of conserved sequence to encoded regulatory information and indeed, the mechanism by which these contribute to long-range transcriptional regulation is not well understood. The ZRS, a highly conserved cis-regulator, is a paradigm for such long-range gene regulation. The ZRS acts over approximately 1 Mb to control spatio-temporal expression of Shh in the limb bud and mutations within it result in a number of limb abnormalities, including polydactyly, tibial hypoplasia and syndactyly. We describe the activity of this developmental regulator and discuss a number of mechanisms by which regulatory mutations in this enhancer function to cause congenital abnormalities.",23650631,Alterations to the remote control of Shh gene expression cause congenital abnormalities.,1,0
"Research into the use of clozapine in older people is somewhat scarce. Clozapine is associated with serious adverse effects such as agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis and metabolic syndrome. Other common undesirable effects such as sedation, constipation (which can be fatal), urinary incontinence and hypersalivation further limit its use. These adverse effects are particularly important for the use of clozapine in older people, who are generally more susceptible to medication-related adverse effects. Whilst clozapine should be used with caution in elderly people, strict monitoring procedures can help to prevent harmful effects through early detection, and certain management techniques exist to minimise them. This review outlines the epidemiology of clozapine-related adverse effects in older people and discusses potential prevention and management strategies.

"The International Council for Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines have been revised allowing for modeling of concentration-QT (C-QT) data from Phase I dose-escalation studies to be used as primary analysis for QT prolongation risk assessment of new drugs. This work compares three commonly used Phase I dose-escalation study designs regarding their efficiency to accurately identify drug effects on QT interval through C-QT modeling. Parallel group design and 4-period crossover designs with sequential or interleaving cohorts were evaluated. Clinical trial simulations were performed for each design and across different scenarios (e.g. different magnitudes of drug effect, QT variability), assuming a pre-specified linear mixed effect (LME) model for the relationship between drug concentration and change from baseline QT (ΔQT). Analyses suggest no systematic bias in either the predictions of placebo-adjusted ΔQT (ΔΔQT) or the LME model parameter estimates across all evaluated designs. Additionally, false negative rates remained similar and adequately controlled across all evaluated designs. However, compared to the crossover designs, the parallel design had significantly less power to correctly exclude a clinically significant QT effect, especially in the presence of substantial intercept inter-individual variability. In such cases, parallel design is associated with increased uncertainty around ΔΔQT prediction, mainly attributed to the uncertainty around the estimation of the treatment-specific intercept in the model. Throughout all the evaluated scenarios, the crossover design with interleaving cohorts had consistently the best performance characteristics. The results from this investigation will further facilitate informed decision-making during Phase I study design and the interpretation of the associated C-QT modeling output.",31664592,Impact of Phase 1 study design on estimation of QT interval prolongation risk using exposure-response analysis.,1,1

Depending on definitions, 25-50 % of patients aged 75 years or older are exposed to at least five drugs. Evidence is increasing that polypharmacy, even when guidelines advise the prescribing of each drug individually, can potentially cause more harm than benefit to older patients, due to factors such as drug-drug and drug-disease interactions. Several approaches reducing polypharmacy and inappropriate prescribing have been proposed, but evidence showing a benefit of these measures regarding clinically relevant endpoints is scarce.

"Background Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are undesirable effects to drugs at doses normally used in the clinical setting for diagnosis, treatment or prophylaxis of diseases. Spontaneous ADR reporting is currently considered as a critical part of ADRs detection. Objective The study aims to assess the knowledge, attitude, and practice of healthcare providers towards adverse drug reaction reporting in public and private settings within the Baghdad area. Method We follow a quantitative cross-sectional study design, using a self-administered questionnaire to collect data from the healthcare providers regarding their reporting practice. Main outcome The outcome measures include the experiences of reporting of adverse drug reactions and the available systems, in addition to the expected benefits to clinical practice. Results Among 485 respondents, 114 were able to differentiate ADRs from side effects. About half of them (47.6%) recognized the availability of reporting systems and 43.3% knew how to report adverse drug reactions. 43.7% of the respondents mentioned that ADRs should be reported only when they are life-threatening. Among the 188 respondents who encountered ADRs, 145 reported the events to the accessible local authority. Conclusion The healthcare providers working in Baghdad healthcare institutions have a good attitude toward ADR reporting. There is a relatively below-standard reporting culture of the encountered adverse reactions. The inadequate knowledge about adverse reactions and the unavailability of reporting forms played a major role in discouraging healthcare professionals to detect and report ADRs.",31240554,Healthcare personnel's experience of reporting adverse drug reactions in Baghdad city: cross-sectional study.,0,1
"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in older adults are an important healthcare problem since they are frequently a cause of hospitalization, occur commonly during admission, and are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Older adults are particularly susceptible to ADRs because they are usually on multiple drug regimens and because age is associated with changes in pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. The presentation of an ADR in older adults is often atypical, which further complicates its recognition. One potential strategy for improving recognition of ADRs is to identify those patients who are at risk of an ADR. The recently developed GerontoNet ADR Risk Score is a practical tool for identification of older patients who are at increased risk for an ADR and who may represent a target for interventions aimed at reducing ADRs. Provision of adequate education in the domain of clinical geriatric pharmacology can improve recognition of ADRs. Besides formal surveillance systems, built-in computer programs with electronic prescribing databases and clinical pharmacist involvement in patient care within multidisciplinary geriatric teams might help to minimize the occurrence of ADRs. In addition, a number of actions can be taken in hospitals to stimulate appropriate prescribing and to assure adequate communication between primary and hospital care. In older adults with complex medical problems and needs, a global evaluation obtained through a comprehensive geriatric assessment may be helpful in simplifying drug prescription and prioritizing pharmacological and healthcare needs, resulting in an improvement in quality of prescribing.",22642780,Adverse drug reactions in older people: detection and prevention.,0,1
"The prevention of adverse drug reactions to antivenom serum poses a formidable challenge in the management of snakebite. Hydrocortisone is being used concurrently with antivenom in order to prevent these adverse drug reactions without a proven benefit. However, all previous studies seemed to ignore the testing of effectiveness of hydrocortisone therapy during its pharmacological effects, which come hours later. On this principle, we aimed to test the effectiveness of intravenous hydrocortisone given 2 h or more prior to the commencement of antivenom therapy to reduce adverse drug reactions to antivenom. In an open-labelled randomized controlled trial, patients with a history of snakebite were randomly assigned to receive either 500 mg intravenous hydrocortisone bolus given 2 h or more prior to antivenom therapy (Group A) or at the time of antivenom therapy (Group B). The primary endpoint was the reduction of adverse drug reactions to antivenom of any grade of severity within the first 48 h. This trial has been registered with the ""Sri Lanka Clinical Trials Registry"", number SLCTR/2010/005. A total of 236 patients were randomized to group A or Group B. In the group A, 38 participants received hydrocortisone 2 h before administration of antivenom whilst 33 received hydrocortisone less than 2 h before administration of antivenom. In the Group B, 84 participants received hydrocortisone at the time of antivenom therapy. In Group A (n, 38), and Group B (n, 84), 15 patients (39%) and 29 patients (35%) developed reactions respectively and the difference is not significant (p = 0.598). Moreover, hydrocortisone therapy did not significantly reduce the occurrence of antievnom reactions of any grade of severity. Further, it didn't delay the occurrence of antivenom reactions in patients who received hydrocortisone either more than 2 h or less than 2 h before the antivenom as opposed to the control group (group B). Intravenous hydrocortisone shows no difference in the timing, rate or severity of adverse drug reactions to antivenom when administered simultaneously and up to 4 h prior to antivenom.

"Concurrent use of herbal medicine (HM) and conventional medicine (CM) is increasing. However, little is known about the prevalence of drug-induced liver injury (DILI) related to this concurrent use. In order to investigate changes in liver enzymes during concurrent use of HM and CM and to assess the prevalence of DILI related to their concurrent use, we screened for liver injury among inpatients at our institution who were administered both HM and CM for at least 14 days while hospitalized between 2006 and 2010. We used the Council for International Organization of Medical Science (CIOMS) laboratory criteria to define liver injury. Of the 892 patients included in the study, 34 (3.81%) had liver injury on admission and 21 (2.35%) had liver injury at discharge. Of the 48 cases that fulfilled the CIOMS laboratory criteria for liver injury, 34 had preexisting liver injury. The remaining 14 were analyzed, and five were concluded to have DILI, resulting in a prevalence of 5/892 (0.56%, with a 95% confidence interval of 0.07-1.05%). Overall, clinical symptoms of liver injury were mild. We thus contend that concurrent use of HM and CM is relatively safe.",21802919,Liver enzyme abnormalities during concurrent use of herbal and conventional medicines in Korea: a retrospective study.,1,1

"Routine anatomic ultrasound performed in the second trimester has a detection rate of approximately 70-90% for fetal congenital abnormalities (Nyberg and Souter, J Ultrasound Med 2001;6:655-674). The central nervous system abnormalities are one of the most common ones detected. Chiari malformation is among the CNS abnormalities diagnosed in the fetal period (Bianchi et al., Fetology - diagnosis and management of the fetal patient, McGraw-Hill, 2000). The Arnold-Chiari malformation was first described in 1883 by Cleland (Romero et al., Prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies, Appleton and Lange, 1988). It is characterised by the prolapse of the hindbrain structures below the level of the foramen magnum. It can be associated with skeletal abnormalities and neurological dysfunction. In type I, a lip of cerebellum is downwardly displaced with the tonsils, but the fourth ventricle remains in the posterior fossa. This condition may coexist with syringomyelia, which is a cyst formation on the cervical portion of the spinal cord (Creasy et al., Maternal fetal medicine principles and practice, 2004). We present a case where Chiari type 1 and syringomyelia detected at 18 weeks of gestation. The reason for referral to our center was an abnormal inward posturing of both upper and lower extremities (minimal gross movement and almost inexistent range of motion on fetal joints). On further fetal evaluation, an abnormal brain ultrasound was identified.

"The aims of this study were to determine a suitable method to correct the ventricular repolarization period against the RR interval in isolated perfused Langendorff guinea pig heart and to clarify the reliability of this model using several drugs. QT and RR intervals from an electrocardiogram and the epicardial monophasic action potential duration (MAP(90)) were measured. Two drugs clinically known to be QT-prolonging (E-4031, moxifloxacin) and two known to be non-QT-prolonging (verapamil, zatebradine) were used for the study. To determine a method of correcting the ventricular repolarization period against RR interval, heart rates were slowed with 0.3 µM zatebradine, a specific bradycardiac agent, and then accelerated with atrial pacing to obtain a wide range of MAP(90)/RR relationships. An exponential rate-correction model elicited the most appropriate algorithm for the relationship among the four models tested. Based on linear regression analysis, the exponential showed superior dissociation of corrected MAP(90)s against RR intervals than generic Bazett's and Fridericia's formulae. E-4031 and moxifloxacin prolonged the corrected QT (QTc) intervals and MAP(90) under atrial pacing at a cycle length of 0.25 sec (MAP(90(pacing))) dose-dependently; verapamil and zatebradine failed to prolong them, indicating that the reliability of this model was excellent. MAP(90(pacing)) prolongation by moxifloxacin, the positive compound in the clinical ""Thorough QT/QTc Study"", was seen at around QTc-prolonging concentrations in clinic, suggesting that the sensitivity would be appropriate for QT evaluation. We therefore concluded that the isolated guinea pig heart model is sufficiently sensitive and useful for assessing the potential QT prolongation of drugs.",20930463,Accurate detection of drug-induced delayed ventricular repolarization with a suitable correction formula in Langendorff guinea pig heart.,1,1

"When congenital anomalies are diagnosed on prenatal ultrasound, the current standard of care is to perform G-banded karyotyping on cultured amniotic cells. Chromosomal microarray (CMA) can detect smaller genomic deletions and duplications than traditional karyotype analysis. CMA is the first-tier test in the postnatal evaluation of children with multiple congenital anomalies. Recent studies have demonstrated the utility of CMA in the prenatal setting and have advocated for widespread implementation of this technology as the preferred test in prenatal diagnosis. However, CMA remains significantly more expensive than karyotype. In this study, we performed an economic analysis of cytogenetic technologies in the prenatal diagnosis of sonographically detected fetal anomalies comparing four strategies: (i) karyotype alone, (ii) CMA alone, (iii) karyotype and CMA, and (iv) karyotype followed by CMA if the karyotype was normal. In a theoretical cohort of 1,000 patients, CMA alone and karyotype followed by CMA if the karyotype was normal identified a similar number of chromosomal abnormalities. In this model, CMA alone was the most cost-effective strategy, although karyotype alone and CMA following a normal karyotype are both acceptable alternatives.

"Perinatal autopsy detects the cause of death and also finds the various types of congenital malformation involving one or more than one system. Congenital malformations are one of the leading causes of perinatal deaths and infant mortality. In the present study various visceral malformations were detected in perinatal autopsies and categorised them systemwise. The prospective study was conducted during the period of June 2007 to May 2009 consisting of 32 cases. Out of 32 perinatal deaths studied, 30 were stillborn and in 2 there were early neonatal deaths. In each case, an attempt was made to find out the congenital malformation in perinatal deaths and clinicopathological correlation was attempted after a detailed postmortem and histopathological study. Congenital malformations were seen in 10 cases which accounted for 31.2% of perinatal deaths. A total of 64 congenital malformations were observed in 10 cases. Malformations of the alimentary system (20.31%) were most common followed by genito-urinary system (18.75%), musculoskeletal system (17.18%) and central nervous system (9.37%).

"Identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a critical enabler for reducing adverse drug events and improving patient safety. Generating proper DDI alerts during prescribing workflow has the potential to prevent DDI-related adverse events. However, the implementation of DDI alerting system remains a challenge as users are experiencing alert overload which causes alert fatigue. One strategy to optimize the current system is to establish a list of high-priority DDIs for alerting purposes, though it is a resource-intensive task. In this study, we propose a machine learning framework to extract useful features from the FDA adverse event reports and then identify potential high-priority DDIs using an autoencoder-based semi-supervised learning algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of using adverse event feature representations in differentiating high- and low-priority DDIs. Additionally, the proposed algorithm utilizes stacked autoencoders and weighted support vector machine for boosting classification performance, which outperforms other competing methods in terms of F-measure and AUC score. This framework integrates multiple information sources, leverages domain knowledge and clinical evidence, and provides a practical approach for pre-screening high-priority DDI candidates for medication alerts.",31395567,Semi-Supervised Learning Algorithm for Identifying High-Priority Drug-Drug Interactions Through Adverse Event Reports.,0,1

"MedDRA (Medical Dictionary tor Regulatory Activities) is a standardised medical terminology, published by the International Council for Harmonisation, used in particular for coding cases of adverse effects in clinical study reports and pharmacovigilance databases, and to facilitate searches in these databases. MedDRA has a 5-level, hierarchical structure. Some levels are used to code adverse effects, and the others are designed to group together related terms for database searches. The links between these terms are hierarchical and complex. In addition to searches for terms, broad or narrow searches of MedDRA-coded databases can be performed using predefined ""standardised Med-DRA queries"", of which about a hundred are available in early 2016. A French study on 4 adverse effects recorded in France's national pharma- covigilance database showed that the effectiveness of MedDRA and stan- dardised MedDRA queries is highly variable, depending on the adverse effect examined. In some cases, less than half of the cases retrieved were relevant. A study on the adverse effects most frequently reported in clinical trials of 10 randomly selected drugs showed that a given adverse effect could be described using between 4 and several hundred different codes. One risk of fragmenting the reporting of adverse effects across multiple terms is that their true frequency will be underestimated. The development of a harmonised international terminology is a worth-while endeavour. But the complexity of MedDRA and its poorly evaluated performance make it susceptible to manipulation, errors of interpretation and bias. This applies in particular to the adverse effect statistics in the clinical study reports of clinical trials. The evaluation of the effectiveness of MedDRA as a tool for identifying and quantifying the adverse effects of new drugs must continue. For healthcare professionals, the limitations of MedDRA are one more reason to recognise that the known adverse effects of drugs, and their quantification, tend to be underestimated.",30645835,MedDRA and pharmacovigilance: a complex and little-evaluated tool.,0,1

"ATP-dependent potassium channel openers such as pinacidil and levcromakalim have long been known to shorten action potential duration and to be profibrillatory in non-clinical models, raising concerns on the clinical safety of drugs that shorten QT interval. Routine non-clinical evaluation of new drugs for their potential to affect cardiac repolarization has revealed that drugs may also shorten QT interval. The description of congenital short QT syndrome in 2000, together with the associated arrhythmias, suggests that drug-induced short QT interval may be proarrhythmic, and an uncanny parallel is evolving between our appreciation of the short and the long QT intervals. Epidemiological studies report an over-representation of short QT interval values in patients with idiopathic ventricular fibrillation. Therefore, as new compounds that shorten QT interval are progressed further into clinical development, questions will inevitably arise on their safety. Arising from the current risk-averse clinical and regulatory environment and concerns on proarrhythmic safety of drugs, together with our lack of a better understanding of the clinical significance of short QT interval, new drugs that substantially shorten QT interval will likely receive an unfavourable regulatory review unless these drugs fulfil an unmet clinical need. This review provides estimates of parameters of QT shortening that may be of potential clinical significance. Rufinamide, a recently approved anticonvulsant, illustrates the current regulatory approach to drugs that shorten QT interval. However, to further substantiate or confirm the safety of these drugs, their approval may well be conditional upon large-scale post-marketing studies with a focus on cardiac safety.",19563537,Drug-induced QT interval shortening: potential harbinger of proarrhythmia and regulatory perspectives.,1,1

"For a number of prospective parents, uncertainty during pregnancy starts when an anomaly is found during a routine fetal anomaly scan. This may be followed by numerous tests to determine the etiology and nature of the anomaly. In this study, we aimed to understand how prospective parents perceive and manage uncertainty after being confronted with a structural anomaly during their routine ultrasound. Han's taxonomy of uncertainty was used as a framework to identify and understand the different types of uncertainty experienced. Interviews were held in the UK (n = 8 women and n = 1 male partner) and in the Netherlands (n = 7 women) with participants who had experienced uncertainty in their pregnancy after a fetal scan. Data were analyzed using thematic analysis, and the uncertainties experienced by parents were mapped against the dimensions of the Han taxonomy (sources, issues, and locus). Participants' experience of uncertainty was relevant to all dimensions and subcategories of the Han taxonomy, showing its applicability in the prenatal setting. Sources of uncertainty included receiving probabilistic or ambiguous information about the anomaly, or information that was complex and challenging to understand. Issues of uncertainty included were those that were scientific-such as a probable diagnosis with no further information, personal-such as the emotional impact of uncertainty, and practical-such as limited information about medical procedures and practical aspects of care. Additionally, participants described what helped them to manage uncertainty. This included active coping strategies such as searching for information on the Internet, external coping resources such as seeking social support, and internal coping resources such as using positivity and hope. Several recommendations for the healthcare professional to minimize uncertainty and help the patient deal with uncertainty have been proposed based on these findings.",32638447,Parental experiences of uncertainty following an abnormal fetal anomaly scan: Insights using Han's taxonomy of uncertainty.,0,0

"Zika virus (ZIKV) has been of major international public health concern following large outbreaks in the Americas occurring in 2015-2016. Most notably, ZIKV has been seen to pose dangers in pregnancy due to its association with congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly. Numerous experimental approaches have been taken to address how the virus can cross the placenta, alter normal fetal development, and disrupt specific cellular functions. Many areas concerning the mechanisms of transmission, especially from mother to fetus, are largely unknown but demand further research. Several promising new studies are presented that provide insight into possible mechanisms of transmission, different cell types affected, and immune responses towards the virus. By aiming to better understand the processes behind altered fetal neuronal development due to ZIKV infection, the hope is to find ways to increase protection of the fetus and prevent congenital abnormalities such as microcephaly. As ZIKV infection is spreading to increasingly more areas and bringing harmful outcomes and birth defects with it, it is imperative to identify the mechanisms of transmitting this infectious agent, consider different genetic backgrounds of hosts and strain types, and navigate methods to protect those affected from the detrimental effects of this newly emerging virus.",28804687,Zika Virus (ZIKV): a review of proposed mechanisms of transmission and associated congenital abnormalities.,1,0

"Jegou et al. (2012) have reported prenatal alcohol exposure (PAE)-induced reductions of angiogenesis-related proteins in mouse placenta. These effects were associated with striking alterations in microvascular development in neonatal cerebral cortex. Here, we employed a rat model of moderate PAE to search for additional proteins whose placental and fetal cortical expression is altered by PAE, along with a subsequent examination of fetal cerebral cortical alterations associated with altered protein expression. Long-Evans rat dams voluntarily consumed either a 0 or 5% ethanol solution 4 h each day throughout gestation. Daily ethanol consumption, which resulted in a mean peak maternal serum ethanol concentration of 60.8 mg/dL, did not affect maternal weight gain, litter size, or placental or fetal body weight. On gestational day 20, rat placental: fetal units were removed by Caesarian section. Placental protein expression, analyzed by 2D-PAGE - tandem mass spectroscopy, identified a total of 1,117 protein spots, 20 of which were significantly altered by PAE. To date, 14 of these PAE-altered proteins have been identified. Western blotting confirmed the alterations of two of these placental proteins, namely, annexin-A4 (ANX-A4) and cerebral cavernous malformation protein 3 (CCM-3). Specifically, PAE elevated ANX-A4 and decreased CCM-3 in placenta. Subsequently, these two proteins were measured in fetal cerebral cortex, along with radiohistochemical studies of VEGF binding and histofluorescence studies of microvascular density in fetal cerebral cortex. PAE elevated ANX-A4 and decreased CCM-3 in fetal cerebral cortex, in a pattern similar to the alterations observed in placenta. Further, both VEGF receptor binding and microvascular density and orientation, measures that are sensitive to reduced CCM-3 expression in developing brain, were significantly reduced in the ventricular zone of fetal cerebral cortex. These results suggest that the expression angiogenesis-related proteins in placenta might serve as a biomarker of ethanol-induced alterations in microvascular development in fetal brain.",32655346,Ethanol-Induced Alterations in Placental and Fetal Cerebrocortical Annexin-A4 and Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Protein 3 Are Associated With Reductions in Fetal Cortical VEGF Receptor Binding and Microvascular Density.,0,0

"Epidemiological studies suggest there are considerable differences in the prevalence and presentation of depression in men and women. Women are more than twice as likely to be diagnosed with depression and may also report more atypical and anxiety symptoms than men. Men and women also differ in the metabolism and distribution of antidepressants and the presence of oestrogen in women of childbearing age may interfere with the mechanism of action of a number of antidepressants. These differences have led many researchers to question whether antidepressants are equally effective and tolerated in men and women. While some reports suggest that selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are more effective and result in fewer adverse drug reactions in women than tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), gender differences in antidepressant response remains a controversial topic. The potential effects of antidepressant exposure in utero and in breast milk further complicate treatment options for antenatal and postnatal depression. While some research suggests the SSRI paroxetine is teratogenic, further carefully designed naturalistic studies are required to fully evaluate these effects. Finally, response to antidepressants and the occurrence of adverse drug reactions is marked by inter-individual variability which may be in part due to genetic differences. Future studies should therefore consider genotypes of the mother, foetus and infant in antidepressant response.",21047161,Gender differences in antidepressant drug response.,1,1

"Drug-induced torsade de pointes (TdP) has proved to be a significant iatro-genic cause of morbidity and mortality and a major reason for the withdrawal of a number of drugs from the market in recent times. Enzymes that metabolise many of these drugs and the potassium channels that are responsible for cardiac repolarisation display genetic polymorphisms. Anecdotal reports have suggested that in many cases of drug-induced TdP, there may be a concealed genetic defect of either these enzymes or the potassium channels, giving rise to either high plasma drug concentrations or diminished cardiac repolarisation reserve, respectively. The presence of either of these genetic defects may predispose a patient to TdP, a potentially fatal adverse reaction, even at therapeutic dosages of QT-prolonging drugs and in the absence of other risk factors. Advances in pharmacogenetics of drug metabolising enzymes and pharmacological targets, together with the prospects of rapid and inexpensive genotyping procedures, promise to individualise and improve the benefit/risk ratio of therapy with drugs that have the potential to cause TdP. The qualitative and the quantitative contributions of these genetic defects in clinical cases of TdP are unclear because not all of the patients with TdP are routinely genotyped and some relevant genetic mutations still remain to be discovered. There are regulatory guidelines that recommend strategies aimed at uncovering the risk of TdP associated with new chemical entities during their development. There are also a number of guidelines that recommend integrating pharmacogenetics in this process. This paper proposes a strategy for integrating pharmacogenetics into drug development programmes to optimise association studies correlating genetic traits and endpoints of clinical interest, namely failure of efficacy or development of repolarisation abnormalities. Until pharmacogenetics is carefully integrated into all phases of development of QT-prolonging drugs and large-scale studies are undertaken during their post-marketing use to determine the genetic components involved in induction of TdP, routine genotyping of patients remains unrealistic. Even without this pharmacogenetic data, the clinical risk of TdP can already be greatly minimised. Clinically, a substantial proportion of cases of TdP are due to the use of either high or usual dosages of drugs with potential to cause TdP in the presence of factors that inhibit drug metabolism. Therefore, choosing the lowest effective dose and identifying patients with these non-genetic risk factors are important means of minimising the risk of TdP. In view of the common secondary pharmacology shared by these drugs, a standard set of contraindications and warnings have evolved over the last decade. These include factors responsible for pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic drug interactions. Among the latter, the more important ones are bradycardia, electrolyte imbalance, cardiac disease and co-administration of two or more QT-prolonging drugs. In principle, if large scale prospective studies can demonstrate a substantial genetic component, pharmacogenetically driven prescribing ought to reduce the risk further. However, any potential benefits of pharmacogenetics will be squandered without any reduction in the clinical risk of TdP if physicians do not follow prescribing and monitoring recommendations.",14756578,Pharmacogenetic aspects of drug-induced torsade de pointes: potential tool for improving clinical drug development and prescribing.,1,1
"Drug side effects, or adverse drug reactions (ADRs), have become a major public health concern and often cause drug development failure and withdrawal. Some ADRs always occur concomitantly. Therefore, identifying these ADRs and their common molecular basis can better promote their prevention and treatment. In this paper we predicted the potential proteins for ADR pairs with similar mechanisms based on three layers of information: (i) the drug co-occurrence between a pair of ADRs; (ii) the correlation between a protein and an ADR pair based on the co-occurrence of drugs and (iii) the interaction between these proteins within the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. The methods of randomization and functional annotation are used to investigate and analyze the relation between causative proteins and similar ADR pairs. The prediction accuracy of the relation between similar ADR pairs and related proteins reached 80%, and it increases with the number of drugs shared by the ADR pairs. From the ADR network made of single ADRs from predicted similar ADR pairs, we found that some ADRs are involved in multiple ADR pairs. The functional analysis of these ADR-related proteins suggests that a similar molecular basis is shared by multiple ADR pairs containing the same ADR, and these ADR pairs are almost caused by the same drug sets. The results of this study are reliable and provide a theoretical basis for the better prevention and treatment of ADRs that always occur concomitantly.

Survivors without surgical treatment mainly have simple malformations; but a few have complex diseases, and some have survived with secondary pulmonary hypertension. Among operated malformations there are patients with a 'complete' repair (anatomical and physiological), others with a definitive palliation (physiological repair) and some with a simple palliation.

Arrhythmias, bacterial endocarditis, cyanosis, polycythemia, heart failure, anomalies of pulmonary circulation, deterioration or malfunction of devices, need of cardiac and non-cardiac surgery, intercurrent non-cardiac diseases, and a need for cardiac and non-cardiac diagnostic procedures are common problems of adults with congenital heart disease. Physiological events such as pregnancy and childbearing deserve a careful multidisciplinary approach. While most simple native and well corrected GUCH do not require very specialized treatments throughout their life, the abnormalities and complexities of postoperative anatomy are often beyond the expertise of the adult cardiologist, requiring multidisciplinary competence in specialized tertiary centers. The problem is still unresolved and involves cultural, medical, technological and economically relevant issues.",17255822,The grown-up congenital cardiac patient.,1,1

"Considerable interindividual variability in response to cardiovascular pharmacotherapy exists with drug responses varying from being efficacious to inadequate to induce severe adverse events. Fueled by advancements and multidisciplinary collaboration across disciplines such as genetics, bioinformatics, and basic research, the vision of personalized medicine, rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, may be within reach. Pharmacogenetics offers the potential to optimize the benefit-risk profile of drugs by tailoring diagnostic and treatment strategies according to the individual patient. To date, a multitude of studies has tried to delineate the effects of gene-drug interactions for drugs commonly used to treat cardiovascular-related disease. The focus of this review is on how genetic variability may modify drug responsiveness and patient outcomes following therapy with commonly used cardiovascular drugs including clopidogrel, warfarin, statins, and β-blockers. Also included are examples of how genetic studies can be used to guide drug discovery and examples of how genetic information may be deployed in clinical decision making.",29801582,Pharmacogenetics in Cardiovascular Medicine.,1,1
"Carbamazepine (CBZ) is a first-line widely used anticonvulsant. It has a narrow therapeutic index and exhibits considerable interindividual and interethnic variability in clinical efficacy and adverse drug reactions including potentially life-threatening hypersensitivity reactions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis. The most important pharmacogenetic finding is related to the association of CBZ-induced hypersensitivity with human leukocyte antigens (HLA class I and II alleles). Moreover, genotyping for HLA-B*15:02 allele is required prior to initiating CBZ in Asians and Asian ancestry patients, demonstrating the usefulness of biomarkers to avoid adverse drug reactions. On the other hand, in order to explain the differences in the clinical response to CBZ, genetic polymorphisms in phase I (CYP3A4, CYP3A5 and EPHX1) and phase II (UGT2B7) metabolising enzymes have been assessed; additionally, the influence of transporters (ABCB1 and ABCC2), receptors (PXR) and other drug targets (voltage- gated Na+ channels) in CBZ clinical response has been evaluated.

Of 22,843 cases with CA, 506 (2.2%) had mothers with senna treatment, while of 38,151 control newborn infants without CA, 937 (2.5%) were born to mothers with senna treatment (adjusted OR with 95% CI: 1.0, 0.9-1.1), and of 834 malformed controls with Down syndrome, 26 (3.1%) had mothers with the use of senna (OR with 95% CI: 0.7, 0.5-1.1).

"Drugs are frequently prescribed to patients with the aim of improving each patient's medical state, but an unfortunate consequence of most prescription drugs is the occurrence of undesirable side effects. Side effects that occur in more than one in a thousand patients are likely to be signaled efficiently by current drug surveillance methods, however, these same methods may take decades before generating signals for rarer side effects, risking medical morbidity or mortality in patients prescribed the drug while the rare side effect is undiscovered. In this paper, we propose a novel computational metaanalysis framework for signaling rare side effects that integrates existing methods, knowledge from the web,metric learning, and semisupervised clustering. The novel framework was able to signal many known rare and serious side effects for the selection of drugs investigated, such as tendon rupture when prescribed Ciprofloxacin or Levofloxacin, renal failure with Naproxen and depression associated with Rimonabant. Furthermore, for the majority of the drugs investigated it generated signals for rare side effects at a more stringent signaling threshold than existing methods and shows the potential to become a fundamental part of post marketing surveillance to detect rare side effects.",24043412,A novel semisupervised algorithm for rare prescription side effect discovery.,0,1

"One-third of all congenital birth defects affect the head and face, and most craniofacial anomalies are considered to arise through defects in the development of cranial neural crest cells. Cranial neural crest cells give rise to the majority of craniofacial bones, cartilages and connective tissues. Therefore, understanding the events that control normal cranial neural crest and subsequent craniofacial development is important for elucidating the pathogenetic mechanisms of craniofacial anomalies and for the exploring potential therapeutic avenues for their prevention. Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a congenital disorder characterized by severe craniofacial anomalies. An animal model of TCS, generated through mutation of Tcof1, the mouse (Mus musculus) homologue of the gene primarily mutated in association with TCS in humans, has recently revealed significant insights into the pathogenesis of TCS. Apoptotic elimination of neuroepithelial cells including neural crest cells is the primary cause of craniofacial defects in Tcof1 mutant embryos. However, our understanding of the mechanisms that induce tissue-specific apoptosis remains incomplete. In this review, we describe recent advances in our understanding of the pathogenesis TCS. Furthermore, we discuss the role of Tcof1 in normal embryonic development, the correlation between genetic and environmental factors on the severity of craniofacial abnormalities, and the prospect for prenatal prevention of craniofacial anomalies.

"As alternative models and scientific advancements improve the ability to predict developmental toxicity, the challenge is how to best use this information to support safe use of pharmaceuticals in humans. While in vivo experimental data are often expected, there are other important considerations that drive the impact of developmental toxicity data to human risk assessment and product labeling. These considerations include three key elements: (1) the drug's likelihood of producing off-target toxicities, (2) risk tolerance of adverse effects based on indication and patient population, and (3) how much is known about the effects of modulating the target in pregnancy and developmental biology. For example, there is little impact or value of a study in pregnant monkeys to inform the risk assessment for a highly specific monoclonal antibody indicated for a life-threatening indication against a target known to be critical for pregnancy maintenance and fetal survival. In contrast, a small molecule to a novel biological target for a chronic lifestyle indication would warrant more safety data than simply in vitro studies and a literature review. Rather than accounting for innumerable theoretical possibilities surrounding each potential submission's profile, we consolidated most of the typical situations into eight possible scenarios across these three elements, and present a discussion of these scenarios here. We hope that this framework will facilitate a rational approach to determining what new information is required to inform developmental toxicity risk of pharmaceuticals in context of the specific needs of each program while reducing animal use where possible.",27601206,"Goldilocks' Determination of What New In Vivo Data are ""Just Right"" for Different Common Drug Development Scenarios, Part 1.",1,1
"Currently interferon alfa-2b (IFNα-2b) is an approved adjuvant drug for high-risk melanoma patients that leads to an improvement in disease-free survival (DFS). However, it is unclear whether it also impacts overall survival. Widespread use of adjuvant high-dose IFNα has been tempered by its significant toxicity and its limited efficacy. Current therapeutic strategies like immune checkpoint blockade or targeted therapy may also be useful in the adjuvant setting. Therefore, it is important to weigh the trade-offs between possible side effects and therapeutic benefit.We assessed patient utilities for health states associated with IFN therapy. Utilities are measures of preference for a specific health state on a scale of 0 (death) to 1 (perfect health).Utilities were determined for health states associated with adjuvant IFN among 130 German low-risk melanoma patients using the standard gamble technique. Four IFNα-2b toxicity scenarios and the following 3 posttreatment outcomes were assessed: disease-free health and melanoma recurrence (with or without previous use of IFNα-2b) resulting in cancer death. Patients were asked to trade-off the improvement in 5-year DFS and the IFN-related side effects.Utilities for melanoma recurrence (mean 0.60) were significantly lower than for all IFNα-2b toxicity scenarios (mean 0.81-0.90). Patients were willing to tolerate mild-to-moderate and severe toxicity for a 50% and 75% chance of 5-year DFS, respectively. Both utilities and threshold benefits were mostly independent from patient characteristics like gender, income, and social situation. Significant impact was only observed by age and previous personal experience with cancer.On average, German patients were willing to trade even severe IFNα-2b toxicity for reducing the rate of melanoma recurrence. This result points out the importance of a relapse-free survival for melanoma patients.

"Peptic ulcer disease (PUD) is a common disease which can also occur in pregnant women. However, the possible association of PUD and related drug treatments in pregnant women with the risk of structural birth defects (i.e. congenital abnormalities [CA]) in their offspring has not been estimated in controlled population-based epidemiological studies. Thus, the prevalence of PUD in pregnant women who later delivered babies (cases) with different CA and in pregnant women who delivered newborns without CA (controls) was compared in the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities. Controls were matched to cases. Of 22,843 cases with congenital abnormalities, 182 (0.80%) had mothers with reported/recorded PUD, while of 38,151 controls, 261 (0.68%) were born to mothers with reported/recorded PUD.

"The goal of the present study was to examine the utility of the conscious dog model by assessing the QT-interval-prolonging potential of ten positive compounds that have been reported to induce QT interval prolongation in clinical use and seven negative compounds considered not to have such an effect. Three doses of test compounds or vehicle were administered orally to male beagle dogs (n=4), and telemetry signals were recorded for 24 h after administration. All positive compounds (astemizole, bepridil, cisapride, E-4031, haloperidol, MK-499, pimozide, quinidine, terfenadine, and thioridazine) caused a significant increase in the corrected QT (QTc) interval, with a greater than 10% increase achieved at high doses. In contrast, administration of negative compounds (amoxicillin, captopril, ciprofloxacin, diphenhydramine, nifedipine, propranolol, and verapamil) did not produce any significant change in the QTc interval, with the exception of nifedipine that may have produced an overcorrection of the QTc interval due to increased heart rate. The estimated plasma concentrations of the positive compounds that caused a 10% increase in the QTc interval were in good agreement with the plasma/serum concentrations achieved in humans who developed prolonged QT interval or torsade de pointes (TdP).

"Thiopurines are frequently used for the treatment of IBD. The complex pharmacology, metabolism, mechanism of action and toxicity profile of these immunosuppressive drugs have now been partly elucidated. The activity of thiopurines is partly mediated by the metabolite 6-thioguanosine 5'-triphosphate, which inhibits the function of the small GTPase Rac1, leading to apoptosis of activated T cells, and influences the conjugation of T cells with antigen-presenting cells. The activity of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase has a major influence on the bioavailability and toxicity of thiopurines, and several thiopurine metabolites might have adverse effects in patients. Myelotoxicity can be caused by grossly elevated levels of 6-thioguanine nucleotides, and elevated levels of 6-methylmercaptopurine ribonucleotides have been associated with hepatotoxicity. The sensitivity and specificity of these methylated metabolites for predicting thiopurine-induced liver enzyme abnormalities are, however, poor. 6-Thioguanine has been suggested as an alternative to the classical thiopurines azathioprine and 6-mercaptopurine for the treatment of IBD, but there are concerns about its toxicity profile, especially with regard to the induction of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver. Data now suggest that the induction of nodular regenerative hyperplasia of the liver during 6-thioguanine therapy might be dose-dependent or dependent on the level of 6-thioguanine nucleotides.",18043678,Drug Insight: pharmacology and toxicity of thiopurine therapy in patients with IBD.,1,1
"Hypoplastic coronary artery disease is a congenital coronary artery malformation associated with a high risk of sudden cardiac death. However, the etiology and pathogenesis of hypoplastic coronary artery disease remain undefined. Pregestational diabetes increases reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the risk of congenital heart defects. We show that pregestational diabetes in mice induced by streptozotocin significantly increased 4-hydroxynonenal production and decreased coronary artery volume in fetal hearts. Pregestational diabetes also impaired epicardial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) as shown by analyses of the epicardium, epicardial-derived cells, and fate mapping. Additionally, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (Hif-1α), Snail1, Slug, basic fibroblast growth factor (bFgf), and retinaldehyde dehydrogenase (Aldh1a2) was decreased and E-cadherin expression was increased in the hearts of fetuses of diabetic mothers. Of note, these abnormalities were all rescued by treatment with N-acetylcysteine (NAC) in diabetic females during gestation. Ex vivo analysis showed that high glucose levels inhibited epicardial EMT, which was reversed by NAC treatment. We conclude that pregestational diabetes in mice can cause coronary artery malformation through ROS signaling.

"We have systematically identified medicinal products withdrawn worldwide because of adverse drug reactions, assessed the level of evidence used for making the withdrawal decisions, and explored the patterns of withdrawals over time. We searched PubMed, the WHO database of withdrawn products, and selected texts. We included products that were withdrawn after launch from 1950 onwards, excluding non-human and over-the-counter medicines. We assessed the levels of evidence on which withdrawals were based using the Oxford Center for Evidence Based Medicine Levels of Evidence. Of 353 medicinal products withdrawn from any country, only 40 were withdrawn worldwide. Anecdotal reports were cited as evidence for withdrawal in 30 (75%) and deaths occurred in 27 (68%). Hepatic, cardiac, and nervous system toxicity accounted for over 60% of withdrawals. In 28 cases, the first withdrawal was initiated by the manufacturer. The median interval between the first report of an adverse drug reaction that led to withdrawal and the first withdrawal was 1 year (range 0-43 years).

" Some patients do not inform healthcare professionals of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) because they fear termination of aggressive medication therapies. Preferences for aggressive medication therapies may differ between patients and pharmacists. The goal of this study was to estimate whether pharmacists were able to accurately assess patient preference for aggressive medication therapies with potentially stronger ADRs. A cross-sectional study was conducted of hospitalized patients (35 to 74 years of age) receiving oral medications for a chronic disease or systemic chemotherapy at three hospitals in Japan. We estimated the extent of agreement between patient responses and pharmacist predictions using a scenario-based investigation (1) to examine the choice between an aggressive medication therapy and the standard therapy, and (2) to assess increased life expectancy as a result of aggressive medication therapy. The extent of agreement was estimated using the kappa statistic. Of 113 patients, 43 (38.1%) chose the aggressive medication therapy. Pharmacists correctly predicted the choice of 25 (58.1%) of these patients [kappa 0.32 (95% confidence interval 0.15-0.50)]. Of 111 patients, 42 (37.8%) expected one additional life expectancy year. However, pharmacists predicted that as many as 36 (85.7%) of these patients would require more years of added life expectancy before choosing an aggressive medication therapy [kappa 0.24 (0.08-0.40)]. Agreement between patients and pharmacists on the choice of aggressive medication therapy was generally poor. Pharmacists should make an effort to identify patients who might prefer more aggressive medication therapies with potentially stronger ADRs in order to minimize ADR risk.",28867703,Patient Preference for Aggressive Medication Therapies with Potentially Stronger Adverse Drug Reactions Revealed Using a Scenario-based Survey.,0,0
"Here we describe a patient with a new malformation syndrome which shows similarities with Yunis-Varon syndrome (YVS). Prenatal presentation included polyhydramnios, increased nuchal translucency, and bilateral hydrothoraces requiring pigtail insertion. Postnatal presentation revealed primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), persistent hydrothoraces, one atrial and two ventricular septal defects, hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and cerebellar vermis, dilated interhemispheric ventricles, severe developmental delay with general muscular hypotonia, retinal anomalies, sparse scalp hair, sparse eyebrows and eyelashes, hypo- and aplastic nails, low-set dysplastic ears, loose nuchal skin, hypo- and aplastic distal phalanges of the toes as well as postnatal failure to thrive. High resolution molecular karyotyping in the patient did not reveal any causative chromosomal aberration. Since one patient with YVS and PPH has been previously reported, we assume a similar pathogenic pathway. However, molecular confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is not yet possible.

"Citrus aurantium L., commonly known as bitter orange, is widely used in folk medicine, but there is little data in the literature about the effects on pregnancy. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the influence of essential oil obtained from fruits of Citrus aurantium on the maternal reproductive outcome and fetal anomaly incidence in rats. Pregnant Wistar rats were randomized into four groups (n minimum = 12 animals/group): G1 = control, G2 to G4 = treated with essential oil from C. aurantium at dose 125, 250 and 500 mg/kg, respectively. Rats were orally treated, by gavage, with plant essential oil or vehicle during pre-implantation and organogenic period (gestational day 0-14). On gestational day 20 the rats were anaesthetized and the gravid uterus was weighed with its contents and the fetuses were analyzed. Results showed that the treated group with 500 mg/kg presented decreased placental weights and placental index, although the treatment with bitter orange essential oil did not show any alteration in maternal reproductive performance, toxicological effect, changes in ossification sites, and malformation index. In conclusion, the treatment of Citrus aurantium essential oil was not teratogenic and did not alter the maternal reproductive outcome.

"From January 1, 2004 to July 21, 2016 a total of 2 796 cases of adverse drug reaction/adverse event(ADR/AE) after the use of Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets were reported by National Adverse Drug Reaction Monitoring Center. The following results were obtained by analyzing the reports of 2 796 cases of adverse drug reactions/adverse drug events after the use of Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets. A total of 75 patients, accounting for 2.68% of the total ADR/AE time, had severe ADR/AE events. Among them, 30 patients were aged 65 and above, accounting for 40.00% of the total number of severe ADR/AE patients. All the patients with ADR/AE were aged 45-64 years, which totaled 1 346 cases and took up 48.14% of the total patients with ADR/AE. All of ADR/AE cases and severe ADR/AE cases were orally given Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets. Females accounted for 52.50% and 76.00%, respectively, and the proportion of females was significantly higher than that of males. Among patients with a medical history of ADR/AE, severe ADR/AE was higher than the average, accounting for about 1.33%. The proportion of cases orally given 1-3 tablets of Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets in all ADR/AE cases and severe ADR/AE cases was 95.32% and 96.00%, which conformed to the usage in the package insert. All ADR/AE cases and severe ADR/AE cases orally given Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets twice daily occupied the highest proportions, or 77.00% and 61.00%, respectively. The proportion of severe ADR/AE cases orally given Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets was slightly higher than that of all ADR/AE cases in the medication frequency, which didn't conform to the usage in the package insert. All the symptoms of ADR/AE orally given Xianling Gubao Capsules showed many manifestations, and the top 10 symptoms were nausea, rash, itching, stomach dysfunction, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness, diarrhea, anaphylaxis, and reflux heartburn. The symptoms of severe ADR/AE after oral administration of Xianling Gubao Capsules were varied, and the top 10 symptoms were abnormal liver function, rash, suffocation, itching, dizziness, vomiting, anaphylaxis, abdominal pain, weakness, and convulsions. Abnormal liver function accounted for 44.12%. All of ADR/AE cases occurred within 2 days after oral administration of Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets, accounting for 54.26%. Severe ADR/AE occurred within 2 days after the use of Xianling Gubao Capsules/Tablets, accounting for 25.34%.

"Congenital malformations (CMs) are permanent changes produced by abnormality of development in a body structure during prenatal life. Population based studies place the incidence of major malformations at about 2-3% of all live births. The etiology is mostly due multifactorial inheritance or unknown (50-80%). The continuum and gradual shift from genetics to genomics will offer new possibilities for diagnosis, treatment, prediction and prevention of congenital malformations. Genomics has many tools including pathogenomics, pharmacogenomics, nutrigenomics and bioinformatics. Pathogenomics will help to discover new genes or susceptibility genes and genetic variants with a role in the pathogenesis of CMs. Pharmacogenomics will identify genetic variants affecting the response to drugs and it should be applied to study drug induced birth defects. Nutrigenomics will determine the impact of diet on genome stability and how genotype determines nutritional requirements. Bioinformatics then will collect, store obtained data, which will facilitate analysis of systems biology questions involving relationships between genes, their variants and biological functions. This knowledge should be translated into more sensitive and specific genetic tests.",21848005,The role of genomics in prevention or reducing the impact of congenital malformations.,1,0
"<b>Objective:</b> To determine obstetric, intrapartum, and perinatal outcomes for pregnancies with isolated foetal congenital heart defects (CHDs). <b>Methods:</b> This was a retrospective cohort study of women that delivered an infant with an isolated major CHD between January 2010 and April 2017 at a major Australian perinatal centre. The study cohort was compared with a cohort of women with infants without CHD. Cardiac abnormalities were broadly subdivided into the following five categories using the International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision (ICD-10) as a guide - transposition of the great arteries (TGA), septal defects, right heart lesions (RHL), left heart lesions (LHL), and ""other"". Demographic characteristics and obstetric, intrapartum, and perinatal outcomes were compared between the two cohorts. <b>Results:</b> The final study cohort comprised of 342 infants with isolated CHD and 68,911 controls. Of the infants with CHD, 20.4% (70/342) had transposition of the great vessels, 23% (79/342) had septal lesions, 14.6% (50/342) had right sided lesions, 23.3% (80/342) left sided, and 18.4% (63/342) categorised as ""other"". Women with foetal CHD had a higher BMI and had higher rates of cardiac disease, diabetes mellitus, and hypertension, be smokers and consume alcohol compared to controls. The CHD cohort had lower odds of spontaneous vaginal delivery (SVD) (OR 0.73, 95%CI 0.58-0.90) and higher odds of caesarean for nonreassuring foetal status (aOR 1.65, 95%CI 1.07-2.55), birth weight <5th (aOR 3.44, 95%CI 2.38-4.98) and <10th (aOR 2.49, 95%CI 1.82-3.40) centiles, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (aOR 109.14, 95%CI 74.44-160.02), severe respiratory distress (aOR 2.90, 95%CI 2.33-3.76), 5 minutes Apgar score <7 (aOR 2.48, 95%CI 1.46-4.20), severe acidosis (aOR 1.80, 95%CI 1.14-2.85), stillbirth (aOR 4.09, 95%CI 1.62-10.33), neonatal death (aOR 24.30, 95%CI 13.24-44.61), and overall perinatal death (aOR 13.42, 95%CI 8.08-22.30). Infants with TGA had the lowest overall risk of complications whilst infants with RHL, LHL, and ""others"" had the highest risk of adverse outcomes, particularly death. <b>Conclusion:</b> Infants with CHD have overall worse obstetric and perinatal outcomes compared with controls.

"Cases with congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) often have other associated anomalies. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of associated anomalies in CDH in a defined population. The anomalies associated with CDH were collected in all live births, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy during 29 years in 386,088 consecutive pregnancies of known outcome in the area covered by our population based registry of congenital anomalies. Of the 139 cases with CDH born during this period (total prevalence of 3.60 per 10,000), 85 (61.2%) had associated major anomalies. There were 25 (18.0%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities including 12 trisomies 18, and 24 (17.3%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions. There were no predominant recognized dysmorphic conditions, but Fryns syndrome. However, other recognized dysmorphic conditions were registered including fetal alcohol syndrome, de Lange syndrome, sequences (laterality sequence and ectopia cordis), and complexes (limb body wall complex). Thirty six (25.9%) of the cases had non syndromic multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Anomalies of the cardiovascular system (n = 53, 27.5%), the urogenital system (n = 34, 17.6%), the musculoskeletal system (n = 29, 15.0%), and the central nervous system (n = 19, 9.8%) were the most common other congenital anomalies. We observed specific patterns of anomalies associated with CDH which emphasizes the need to evaluate all patients with CDH for possible associated malformations. In conclusion the overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was close to two in three infants, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of cases with CDH. A routine screening for other anomalies may be considered in infants and in fetuses with CDH. One should be aware that the anomalies associated with CDH can be classified into a recognizable anomaly, syndrome or pattern in more than one out of two cases with CDH.",26625659,ASSOCIATED NON DIAPHRAGMATIC ANOMALIES AMONG CASES WITH CONGENITAL DIAPHRAGMATIC HERNIA.,1,0

"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 11 beta-hydroxylase deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. It is caused by reduced or absent activity of 11β-hydroxylase (CYP11B1) enzyme and the resultant defects in adrenal steroidogenesis.

"To evaluate the incidence, type, and risk factors associated with adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by Hospital Pharmacovigilance System (CHPS). A retrospective analysis was performed on 217 patients with COVID-19 admitted to the First Hospital of Changsha in China, from January 17, 2020, to February 29, 2020. The active monitoring model in CHPS was used to detect ADR signals of the hospital information system. The risk factors for the ADRs were classified using the World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system. Univariate and multivariate logistic regressions were carried out to analyze the risk factors of ADRs. Our results showed that the prevalence of ADRs was 37.8% in the patients, which was predominated by drug-induced gastrointestinal disorders and liver system disorders (23.0% vs. 13.8%). The ADR could be explained by the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir and umifenovir by 63.8% and 18.1%, respectively. There were 96.8% of ADRs that occurred within 14 days of hospitalization. Multivariable analysis showed that length of stay (odds ratio (OR): 2.02; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.03-3.96; P = 0.04), number of drugs used in the hospital (OR: 3.17; 95% CI 1.60-6.27; P = 0.001) and underlying basic diseases (OR: 2.07; 95% CI 1.02-4.23; P = 0.04) were independent risk factor for ADRs in the patients.

"Background Signal transduction inhibitors (STIs) have considerably improved treatment of advanced/metastasized renal cell carcinoma (mRCC). Most safety data for these drugs are derived from clinical trials. The purpose of this study was to evaluate which adverse drug reactions are documented during first-line treatments in routine clinical practice. Patients and methods The ongoing prospective German mRCC clinical registry is recruiting patients in 110 oncology and urology outpatient centers. Data from the first 250 patients who had completed first-line treatment were analyzed regarding adverse drug reactions (ADRs) documented in patients' medical records. Results Patients were older than in clinical trials and had comorbidities. Patients were treated with the STIs sunitinib (61%), temsirolimus (14%), sorafenib (10%), or bevacizumab combined with interferon (6%). About 520 ADRs were documented, of which 29% resulted in treatment modifications. The most frequently affected organ system was the gastrointestinal system. The most frequently documented ADRs were mucositis/stomatitis (14%), fatigue (14%), diarrhea (12%), and nausea (12%). Conclusions In routine practice, mRCC first-line treatments using STIs frequently lead to ADRs partly necessitating treatment modifications. The pattern of reported ADRs is similar to that reported in clinical trials, but frequencies of events differ, especially for symptoms of multifactorial origin that are not immediately associated with the treatment. These results indicate that perception and documentation of adverse reactions is different between clinical trials and routine practice, and that reviews of patients' medical records might not be the best method to assess safety in routine practice.",26908232,Adverse reactions in mRCC patients documented in routine practice by German office-based oncologists and uro-oncologists.,0,1
"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a relatively common cause of morbidity and mortality. Many factors can contribute to ADRs, including genetics. The degree to which genetics contributes to ADRs is not entirely clear and varies by drug, as well as the type of ADR. Pharmacogenetics and, more recently, pharmacogenomics have been applied to the field of ADRs for both predictable ADRs and hypersensitivity drug reactions. Evaluations for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and thiopurine S-methyltransferase are commonplace clinical tests to reduce hematologic problems associated with drugs, such as dapsone and azathioprine, respectively. Numerous pharmacogenetic associations have been discovered for immediate hypersensitivity reactions to β-lactams, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs; however, the clinical utility of testing for these genetic associations has not been established. In contrast, pharmacogenetic testing for HLA-B*1502 before carbamazepine in patients of certain Asian ethnicities and testing for HLA-B*5701 before abacavir treatment are recommended.

"Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is caused by a defect in any of the 5 enzymes necessary for the synthesis of cortisol. However, in more than 90% of cases, CAH results from a defect in the enzyme 21-hydroxylase.

"Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) represent one of the most common types of congenital abnormalities. More than 90% of children with critical heart defects achieve adulthood due to improvements in medical and surgical treatments. Nonetheless, survivors are at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders that may lead also to language impairments. The current study analyzed the linguistic proﬁles of a group of school-aged children treated surgically for CHD.Fifteen Children with CHDs (7 girls and 8 boys; mean age = 9.31 with SD = 2.10), without intellectual disability (i.e., IQ>70), who underwent cardiac surgery on cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), were administered a selection of tests from the language assessment tool BVL 4-12. Their performance was compared with that of 15 healthy children matched for age and gender. As a result, children with CHDs scored significantly lower than healthy peers on tasks tapping lexical and grammatical processing as well as the episodic buffer component of working memory. Interestingly, the two groups did not differ on tasks assessing their lexical repertoire and phonological discrimination abilities. These findings are discussed in light of current theories of cognitive development and functioning.",31120368,Toward a characterization of language development in children with congenital heart disease: A pilot study.,0,0

"Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (PFD) is a rare non-inherited genetic disorder characterized by osteolytic lesions in multiple bones causing bone pain, deformity, and pathological fracture. As an anti-osteolytic agent, the new generation bisphosphonate zoledronic acid (ZOL) restricts lesion progression by inhibiting osteoclastic activity. Although ZOL is more effective than pamidronate, its efficacy and safety in long-term therapy in PFD is unknown. We report a case of PFD advanced to extensive bone destruction in the skull and ribs and evaluate the efficacy and long-term safety of early first-line ZOL in PFD with severe bone disease, recommending possible future treatments. The annual infusion of 5 mg ZOL was intravenously administered, cumulatively 20 mg over four courses, with oral supplementation of calcium, vitamin D, and potassium. No long-term use side effect was observed, and mild transient symptoms were easily resolved. Significant radiological improvement was seen in filling of destroyed bone and cortical thickening. ZOL decreased both serum collagen type 1 cross-linked C-telopeptide and type 1 procollagen N-terminal (P1NP) from extremely high baseline levels. An unexpected direct increase in P1NP after long-term therapy could indicate discontinuation of ZOL to observe its prolonged effect. Early first-line ZOL therapy is effective in PFD with severe bone destruction and is safe for long-term therapy. The use of bisphosphonates in FD remains off-label, and regular monitoring is highly advised.

"A vital aspect of the drug discovery and development process is the identification and filtering of drugs with high risk of dangerous adverse events. Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is one example of an adverse event that requires thorough in vitro and in vivo drug screening. This is because TdP, a tachycardic ventricular arrhythmia, can develop into fatal cardiac events if left unresolved and has been missed during drug development with profound consequences. These factors led to the development of pre-clinical screening guidelines based on the presence of drug induced QT prolongation (QTp), which has been linked to TdP. These guidelines have high sensitivity, but low specificity, as they tend to predict QTp, which precedes TdP events but does not always lead to TdP. Computational models have the potential to improve these prediction methods by bridging the gaps between preclinical and clinical data. This study proposes the use of adverse event reports obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System as a representation of clinical TdP risk. By incorporating these reports into computational models, a more accurate risk prediction may be developed.",31398384,Relationship of clinical adverse event reports to models of arrhythmia risk.,0,0

"Our clinical experience led us to realize that craniovertebral junction (CVJ) abnormalities were common in surgical patients with congenital muscular torticollis (CMT). This study aimed to report the concurrence rate of CVJ abnormalities in surgical patients with CMT, along with comprehensive evaluation of type of concurrent CVJ abnormalities. This was a retrospective cohort study in a tertiary hospital, including 41 subjects who underwent surgical release for CMT at the mean age of 8.38 years. The presence of CVJ abnormalities was analyzed, using craniofacial 3-dimensional computed tomography images. The concurrence rate of CVJ abnormalities was 70% in surgical patients with CMT. Subjects with CVJ abnormalities had, on average, 1.48 abnormalities. The CVJ abnormalities were rotation and lateral shift of the atlanto-axial joint along with rotation of atlanto-occipital joint, where rotation of the atlanto-axial joint was most common (82.76%). There is no patient with anterior shift of the atlanto-axial joint. Chronic mechanical tension by the contracted unilateral sternocleidomastoid muscle of CMT could be responsible for concurrent CVJ abnormalities. The CVJ abnormalities are more common in the atlanto-axial joint than in the atlanto-occipital joint. In conclusions, CVJ abnormality seems to be a common concurrent skeletal complication of CMT, at least, in surgical patients. The CVJ abnormality might be included in the list of skeletal complications of CMT. If CVJ abnormalities are significantly more common in surgical patients with CMT, CVJ abnormalities might be one of predictors of surgical patients with CMT.",29485567,Craniovertebral Junction Abnormalities in Surgical Patients With Congenital Muscular Torticollis.,1,0
"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causes immune dysregulation, potentially affecting response to vaccines in infected persons. We investigated if unexpected adverse events (AEs) or unusual patterns of AEs after vaccination were reported among HIV-positive persons. We searched for domestic reports among HIV-positive persons to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) during 1990-2016. We analyzed reports by age group (<19 and ≥19 years), sex, serious or non-serious status, live vaccine type (live versus inactivated), AEs reported, and CD4 counts. Of 532,235 reports received, 353 (0.07%) described HIV-positive persons, of whom 67% were aged ≥19 years, and 57% were male; most reports (75%) were non-serious. The most commonly reported inactivated vaccines were pneumococcal polysaccharide (27%) and inactivated influenza (27%); the mostly reported common live virus vaccines were combination measles, mumps, and rubella (8%) and varicella (6%). Injection site reactions were commonly reported (39%). Of 67 reports with CD4 counts available, 41 (61%) described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination (CD4 count <500 cells/mm3), and differed from overall reports only in that varicella was the most common live virus vaccine (4 reports). Of 22 reports describing failure to protect against infection, 6 described persons immunocompromised at time of vaccination, among whom varicella vaccine was most common (3 reports). Of 66 reports describing live virus vaccines, 7 described persons with disseminated infection: 6 had disseminated varicella, 3 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. Of 18 reported deaths, 7 resulted from disseminated infection: 6 were among immunocompromised persons, 1 of whom had vaccine strain varicella-zoster virus. We identified no unexpected or unusual patterns of AEs among HIV-positive persons. These data reinforce current vaccine recommendations for this risk group. However, healthcare providers should know their HIV-positive patients' immune status because immunocompromising conditions can potentially increase the risk of rare, but severe, AEs following vaccination with live virus vaccines.",29920551,"Adverse events after vaccination among HIV-positive persons, 1990-2016.",0,1
"The aim of this retrospective study of 330 rabbits (164 males, 166 females) was to determine different vertebral formulas and prevalence of congenital vertebral anomalies in rabbits from radiographs of the cervical (C), thoracic (Th), lumbar (L) and sacral (S) segments of the vertebral column. The number of vertebrae in each segment of vertebral column, position of anticlinal vertebra and localisation and type of congenital abnormalities were recorded. In 280/330 rabbits (84.8%) with normal vertebral morphology, seven vertebral formulas were identified: C7/Th12/L7/S4 (252/330, 76.4%), C7/Th12/L6/S4 (11/330, 3.3%), C7/Th13/L7/S4 (8/330, 2.4%), C7/Th12/L7/S5 (4/330, 1.2%), C7/Th12/L8/S4 (3/330, 0.9%), C7/Th12/L7/S6 (1/330, 0.3%) and C7/Th11/L7/S4 (1/330, 0.3%). The anticlinal vertebra was identified as Th10 in 56.4% of rabbits and Th11 in 42.4% of rabbits. Congenital spinal abnormalities were identified in 50/330 (15.2%) rabbits, predominantly as a single pathology (n=44). Transitional vertebrae represented the most common abnormalities (n=41 rabbits) in the thoracolumbar (n=35) and lumbosacral segments (n=6). Five variants of thoracolumbar transitional vertebrae were identified. Cervical butterfly vertebrae were detected in three rabbits. One rabbit exhibited three congenital vertebral anomalies: cervical block vertebra, thoracic hemivertebra and thoracolumbar transitional vertebra. Five rabbits exhibited congenital vertebral abnormalities with concurrent malalignment, specifically cervical kyphosis/short vertebra (n=1), thoracic lordoscoliosis/thoracolumbar transitional vertebrae (n=1), thoracic kyphoscoliosis/wedge vertebrae (n=2) and thoracolumbar lordoscoliosis/thoracolumbar transitional vertebrae/lumbosacral transitional vertebrae (n=1).

"The use of medication with anticholinergic properties is widespread among older subjects. Many drugs of common use such as antispasmodics, bronchodilators, antiarrhythmics, antihistamines, anti-hypertensive drugs, antiparkinson agents, skeletal muscle relaxants, and psychotropic drugs have been demonstrated to have an anticholinergic activity. The most frequent adverse effects are dry mouth, nausea, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, urinary retention, blurred vision, tachycardia and neurologic impairment such as confusion, agitation and coma. A growing evidence from experimental studies and clinical observations suggests that drugs with anticholinergic properties can cause physical and mental impairment in the elderly population. However, the morbidity and management issues associated with unwanted anticholinergic activity are underestimated and frequently overlooked. Moreover, their possible relation with specific negative outcome in the elderly population is still not firmly established. The aim of the present review was to evaluate the relationship between the use of drugs with anticholinergic activity and negative outcomes in older persons. We searched PubMed and Cochrane combining the search terms ""anticholinergic"", ""delirium"", ""cognitive impairment"", ""falls"", ""mortality"" and ""discontinuation"". Medicines with anticholinergic properties may increase the risks of functional and cognitive decline, morbidity, institutionalization and mortality in older people. However, such evidences are still not conclusive probably due to possible confounding factors. In particular, more studies are needed to investigate the effects of discontinuation of drug with anticholinergic properties. Overall, minimizing anticholinergic burden should always be encouraged in clinical practice to improve short-term memory, confusion and delirium, quality of life and daily functioning.

"<b>Introduction:</b> Prenatal atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD) on frequent occasions coexists with other cardiac or extracardiac abnormalities or malformation which may change the prognosis and the management with the fetus and the newborn. The aim of the research was to assess the prognosis and the outcome of prenatally diagnosed AVSD based on the classification which also includes coexisting extracardiac abnormalities and malformations as well as its influence on the prenatal consultation.<b>Methods:</b> It was a retrospective analysis of 113 patients with prenatally diagnosed AVSD. The group was selected out of 871 patients with CHD. Out of 113 fetuses with AVSD we exclude those in whom AVSD was coexistent with other cardiac malformations (<i>n</i> = 41). Extracardiac abnormalities [ECA] were defined as problems which do not require surgical intervention after delivery, they were usually markers of a genetic syndrome. Extracardiac malformations [ECM] were defined as problems requiring surgical interventions after delivery or lethal malformations. All 72 fetuses with an isolated AVSD were classified to one of the three groups: (1) Simple AVSD - (sAVSD) - a fetus with isolated AVSD without coexisting ECA and ECM (<i>n</i> = 6), (2) sAVSD + ECA - a fetus with isolated AVSD, with coexisting ECA (<i>n</i> = 28), (3) sAVSD + ECM - a fetus with isolated AVSD, with coexisting ECM (<i>n</i> = 38).<b>Results:</b> The pregnancy from the groups sAVSD + ECM were, in fact, more often referred to the prenatal cardiology centers on account of the existing ECM (<i>p</i>=.03). There were no differences between the two subgroups in regard to: the mean age of the pregnancy, the mean age of the fetus at the time of diagnosis and during diagnostic testing at the referral center, the gender of the fetus. An increased nuchal translucency (NT) was most often found in fetuses from the group AVSD + ECA (<i>n</i> = 13/23), which was connected with more frequent occurrence of abnormal karyotype (<i>p</i>=.048). The trisomy 21 more frequently referred to pregnancy with sAVSD + ECA than those with sAVSD + ECM (<i>p</i>=.0006). In the group sAVSD + ECM there was the highest number of fetuses small for the gestational age detected -48.65% (<i>p</i>=.01). Most often premature deliveries were found in the group sAVSD + ECM (72.73%). The duration of gestation in the group sAVSD + ECM turned out to be much shorter than that in the group with the isolated sAVSD (<i>p</i>=.01) and sAVSD + ECA (<i>p</i>=.03). The lowest Apgar score was in the newborns from the group sAVSD + ECM (<i>p</i>=.002). Longer period of gestation was connected with the higher score on Apgar scale (R = 0.541; <i>p</i>=.001). The average delivery weight of the newborns was the lowest in the group sAVSD + ECM (<i>p</i>=.04). sAVSD + ECM was connected with the significantly higher death rate than the isolated sAVSD (<i>p</i>=.0047) or sAVSD + ECA (<i>p</i><.00001). The fatality rate of the newborns/ fetuses from the pregnancies lasting less than 37 weeks turned out to be much higher than in the case of the remaining pregnancies (sAVSD <i>p</i>=.002).<b>Conclusions:</b> (1) The majority of fetuses with AVSD remained the patients of just obstetricians and prenatal cardiologists because of highly heterogeneous of the coexisting malformations and abnormalities and since they perish in the period of fetal or neonatal life usually they are not seen by the pediatricians or cardiac surgeons. (2) The classification of the AVSD in fetus to a particular group of the prognostic classification of the fetal heart defects helps to plan perinatal management and supplies information regarding the prognosis. (3) The highest mortality rate was in a group of AVSD + ECM, probably due to shorter time of pregnancy duration, fetuses grow restriction and low Apgar score in 1 minute of life.",30514144,Prenatal Atrioventricular Septal Defect (AVSD) as a planned congenital heart disease with different outcome depending on the presence of the coexisting extracardiac abnormalities (ECA) and/or malformations (ECM).,1,0
"The history of intervention trials of periconception folic acid with multivitamin and folic acid supplementation in women has shown a recent breakthrough in the primary prevention of structural birth defects, namely neural-tube defects and some other congenital abnormalities.

"We report a case of left phrenic nerve paralysis due to compression of left auricle caused by congenital partial left pericardial defect. A 56-year-old man was admitted with left phrenic nerve paralysis. His congenital partial left pericardial defect was incidentally diagnosed on video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). This case of left phrenic nerve paralysis was due to compression of the left auricle which protruded through the hole of a partial defect in the pericardium. When the patient was examined for dyspnea at our hospital, the chest X-ray revealed left diaphragmatic relaxation and chest computed tomography showed a high density mass in front of the left pulmonary artery. Electrophysiologic evaluation of the diaphragm by transcutaneous phrenic nerve stimulation indicated complete paralysis of the left phrenic nerve. VATS revealed that the phrenic nerve was compressed by the protruding left auricle due to a congenital partial left pericardial defect. Because of the complete paralysis of the left phrenic nerve, we chose to perform plication of the left diaphragm. The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged on the 23rd day after the operation.

"Gene-environment interactions in the periconceptional period play an increasing role in the pathogenesis of birth defects, including cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/P). The P-glycoprotein, encoded by the ABCB1 gene, is suggested to protect the developing embryo from medication and other xenobiotic exposures. Furthermore, maternal medication use during early pregnancy is a significant risk factor for CL/P offspring. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the association between the maternal and child's functional ABCB1 3435C > T polymorphism, periconceptional medication exposure, and the risk of a child with CL/P. A case-control study was performed among 175 mothers and 98 of their children with CL/P and 83 control mothers and their 65 children. Information on medication and folic acid use was collected. Mothers carrying the 3435TT genotype and using medication showed a 6.2-fold (95% CI = 1.6-24.2) increased risk of having a child with CL/P compared to mothers carrying the 3435CC genotype and not using medication. Periconceptional folic acid use reduced this risk by approximately 30% (OR = 3.9, 95% CI = 0.9-18.0). Mothers carrying the 3435TT genotype, using medication and not taking folic acid showed the highest risk estimate (OR = 19.2, 95% CI = 1.0-369.2).

We hypothesized that children with CHD and additional birth malformations have cryptic chromosomal abnormalities that might be uncovered using recently developed DNA microarray-based methodologies. We recruited 20 children with diverse forms of CHD and additional birth defects who had no chromosomal abnormality identified by conventional cytogenetic testing. Using whole-genome array comparative genomic hybridization, we screened this population, along with a matched control population with isolated heart defects, for chromosomal copy number variations. We discovered disease-causing cryptic chromosomal abnormalities in five children with CHD and additional birth defects versus none with isolated CHD. The chromosomal abnormalities included three unbalanced translocations, one interstitial duplication, and one interstitial deletion. The genetic abnormalities were predominantly identified in children with CHD and a neurologic abnormality. Our results suggest that a significant percentage of children with CHD and neurologic abnormalities harbor subtle chromosomal abnormalities. We propose that children who meet these two criteria should receive more extensive genetic testing to detect potential cryptic chromosomal abnormalities.",18535492,Cryptic chromosomal abnormalities identified in children with congenital heart disease.,1,0

"This Commentary addresses issues related to exposures to teratogens and makes the case for increased research into the safety of medication usage during pregnancy for mothers and fetuses. Not only are medications commonly used during pregnancy, but evidence points to an increasing prevalence and number of drug exposures experienced by the embryo or fetus, particularly during the critical first trimester of pregnancy. Although the first trimester represents a particularly vulnerable period of organogenesis, exposures during other gestational time periods may also be associated with deleterious outcomes. In addition to the changing (and in many cases unknown) risks to a developing fetus, other challenges to studying medication exposures and their effects during pregnancy include the dramatic changes in physiology that occur in pregnant women and the ethical dilemmas posed by including this vulnerable population in randomized controlled trials of safety and efficacy. However, without adequate knowledge of the pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of medication use in pregnancy, women may be under-dosed to minimize exposure or not treated at all, resulting in inadequate treatment and potential harm to the mother and her baby. The Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) is undertaking studies on medications and teratogenic exposures during pregnancy, including alcohol, maternal diabetes, oral hypoglycemic agents, and antiviral medications, through several of its research networks. Although this is a start, there is a critical need for further research on medications used during pregnancy, especially their effects on both the mother and her developing child.",21766436,We don't know what we don't study: the case for research on medication effects in pregnancy.,1,1

"The nocebo reaction, namely the undesirable effect of an inert substance (placebo), is a phenomenon rarely investigated in literature. A better knowledge of this reaction may help clinicians in the management of these patients in clinical practice. Patients with drug adverse reactions (ADR) undergoing the drug challenge test are an ideal model for studying the nocebo effect, and the study aims to investigate their clinical and psychological features. One hundred and twenty patients (Mage = 46.59, SD = 15.5; 82% female), of which 90 non responders and 30 with nocebo reactions (25%) were recruited, and completed a battery of psychological measures: State-Trait Anxiety Inventory X1-X2, Beck Depression Inventory II, Symptoms Checklist-90-R, Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Toronto Alexithymia Scale. Clinical features (individual characteristics and ADR clinical history) were collected by clinicians. The results show that older age (p = 0.002), low level of education (p = 0.039) and a depressive tendency (p = 0.030) appear to be potential risk factors for nocebo effects. Although none of the features related to the previous clinical history appear to represent a risk factor for the nocebo reactions (p minor 0.05), significant correlations between some of the clinical and psychological characteristics considered (p values from 0.005 to 0.042) help to better delineate the profile of these reactive patients.

"There is continuing concern that women who receive breast implants may be at increased risk for adverse reproductive outcomes or experience problems with breastfeeding. It is unknown whether exposure to biomaterials in breast implants may have teratogenic effects or leach into breast milk causing postnatalproblems.

Reports were critically reviewed for lactation difficulties, reproductive problems (spontaneous abortion, delayed conception) and medical conditions among offspring, including neonatal, infant, and childhood diseases and congenital defects that were attributed to implants. We identified 339 reports that described maternal-child adverse events. Nearly half of these reports (46%) described actual problems with breastfeeding or expressed concern that implants would be unsafe or interfere with breastfeeding.

"Imaging plays a key role in the detection of a diaphragmatic pathology in utero. US is the screening method, but MRI is increasingly performed. Congenital diaphragmatic hernia is by far the most often diagnosed diaphragmatic pathology, but unilateral or bilateral eventration or paralysis can also be identified. Extralobar pulmonary sequestration can be located in the diaphragm and, exceptionally, diaphragmatic tumors or secondary infiltration of the diaphragm from tumors originating from an adjacent organ have been observed in utero. Congenital abnormalities of the diaphragm impair normal lung development. Prenatal imaging provides a detailed anatomical evaluation of the fetus and allows volumetric lung measurements. The comparison of these data with those from normal fetuses at the same gestational age provides information about the severity of pulmonary hypoplasia and improves predictions about the fetus's outcome. This information can help doctors and families to make decisions about management during pregnancy and after birth. We describe a wide spectrum of congenital pathologies of the diaphragm and analyze their embryological basis. Moreover, we describe their prenatal imaging findings with emphasis on MR studies, discuss their differential diagnosis and evaluate the limits of imaging methods in predicting postnatal outcome.

"Despite breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, women of childbearing age often desire a pregnancy. Since the average age of women giving birth for the first time is increasing, many young patients diagnosed with breast cancer have not started or completed their family planning.

Current data from retrospective trials do not suggest an increased risk of a recurrence or progress of the disease associated with pregnancy after stage-adjusted treatment. Also, the risk of fetal malformations and damage to the fetus after chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy seems similar to that in the general population.

"In prescription dispensing in Japan, to avoid adverse drug reactions (ADR) pharmacists provide patients with information concerning the initial symptoms (IS) of any ADR that might be caused by the drugs they have been prescribed. However, the usefulness of such information for preventing ADR has not been quantitatively evaluated. We previously performed a trial calculation of the usefulness of rash as a predictor of drug-induced liver disorders by applying Bayes' theorem and showed that the predictive utility of IS can be quantitatively evaluated using likelihood ratios. However, for other drug-ADR-IS combinations it was difficult to obtain the information required for the calculations from Japanese data alone. In this study, using the Adverse Event Reporting System (AERS) database of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), we evaluated 132 drug-ADR-IS combinations that were considered to be potentially clinical significant. Regarding bezafibrate-associated rhabdomyolysis and cibenzoline-associated hypoglycemia, these ADR were not detected in cases involving monotherapy. For 58 combinations, no events that were considered to be IS of the target ADR developed. Fever, nausea, and decreased appetite were the IS of many ADR, making them very useful predictors. In contrast, pruritus and rash were not very useful. Fever might be a predictor of thiamazole-induced agranulocytosis or levofloxacin- or terbinafine-induced liver disorder, tremors might be useful for predicting paroxetine-induced serotonin syndrome, and decreased appetite might be a useful indicator of terbinafine-induced liver dysfunction.

"The clinical practice of pharmaceutical medicine includes contributions from physicians, pharmacists, nurse practitioners, and physician assistants.

A dedicated clinical pharmacology study conducted during a drug's clinical development program has assessed its propensity to induce Torsade using prolongation of the QT interval as seen on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) as a biomarker. Identification of QT-interval prolongation does not necessarily prevent a drug from receiving marketing approval if its overall benefit-risk balance is favorable, but, if approved, a warning is placed in its Prescribing Information.

"The prevalence of congenital cervical agenesis or dysgenesis ranges from 1/80,000 to 1/100,000, and in about 50% of these cases it coexists with congenital vaginal agenesis. This narrative review summarizes the contemporary knowledge in the field of conservative surgical restoration of the reproductive tract. The management of congenital cervical malformations aims to [1] provide relief from the obstructive symptoms, [2] establish normal sexual function, and [3] preserve the uterus for future fertility. In cases of cervical agenesis and vaginal aplasia, the surgical approach involves the creation of neovagina, the creation of neocervix, and then subsequent restoration of the continuity of the genital tract. In cases where vagina is not congenitally absent, the surgical approach involves either a direct uterovaginal anastomosis or initial creation of neocervix and then subsequent restoration of the continuity of the genital tract. The neocervix can be surgically created with small intestinal submucosa, split-thickness skin graft, full-thickness skin graft, peritoneal flap, or vaginal mucosa lined with a polytetrafluoroethylene graft. Most of the published cases report long-term menstruation and sporadic pregnancies. Conservative surgery of cervical congenital malformations could serve as a first-line treatment. Sexual function and menstruation are established in the majority of patients. Extirpatory surgery may be preserved for surgical failures after initial restoration of the continuity of uterus-cervix-vagina or in cases with more complex anatomy.",32228875,Current knowledge about the management of congenital cervical malformations: a literature review.,1,0

"December 2007 marks the 10-year anniversary of the first regulatory guidance for evaluation of drug-induced QT interval prolongation. A decade on, it seems surprising that this document, which was released by the Committee on Proprietary Medicinal Products, caused such acrimony in the industry. Sponsors now routinely evaluate their new drugs for an effect on cardiac electrophysiology in preclinical studies, in addition to obtaining ECGs in all phases of drug development and conducting a formal thorough QT study in humans.However, concurrently, new concerns have also emerged on broader issues related to the cardiovascular safety of drugs because of their potential to shorten the QT interval as well as to induce proischaemic, profibrotic or prothrombotic effects. Drugs may also have an indirect effect by adversely affecting one or more of the cardiovascular risk factors (e.g. through fluid retention or induction of dyslipidaemia). In addition to peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonists and cyclo-oxygenase 2 selective inhibitors, three other drugs, darbepoetin alfa, pergolide and tegaserod, provide a more contemporary regulatory stance on tolerance of cardiovascular risk of drugs and their benefit-risk assessment. This recent, more assertive, risk-averse stance has significant implications for future drug development. These include the routine evaluation of cardiovascular safety for certain classes of drugs. Drugs that are intended for long-term use will almost certainly require long-term clinical evaluation in studies that enrol populations that most closely resemble the ultimate target population. Novel mechanisms of action and biomarkers by themselves are no guarantee of improved safety or benefits. Even some traditional biomarkers have come to be viewed with scepticism. Requirements for more extensive and earlier postmarketing assessment of clinical benefits and rare, but serious risks associated with new medicinal products should create a new standard of evidence for industry and regulators and almost certainly result in better assessment of benefit/risk, more effective and balanced regulatory actions and better care for patients.",18035863,Cardiac repolarisation and drug regulation: assessing cardiac safety 10 years after the CPMP guidance.,1,1

"Operations for left ventricular outflow tract abnormalities are centred on hemodynamic conditions that relate to subvalvar stenosis, valvar stenosis/regurgitation, aortic annular hypoplasia, and supravalvar aortic stenosis. Operative interventions over the years have evolved because the intervening outcomes proved to be unsatisfactory. The resection for subvalvar aortic stenosis has progressed from a fibrous ""membrane"" resection to a more extensive fibromuscular resection. Operative solutions for valvar aortic stenosis and regurgitation have resulted in operative interventions that depend on simple commissurotomy, leaflet extensions, prosthetic mechanical valve replacement, biologic valve replacement, including the pulmonary autograft, and operations to treat aortic annular stenosis. Although there are enthusiastic proponents for all of these strategies, the fact remains that none have proven to be curative; patients can expect to undergo further procedures during their lifetimes.

The observed manifestations in our patient during fetal period indicate a severe form and they were probably exacerbated by the maternal use of amitriptyline during the first 4 months of pregnancy. Unfortunately, he died at 3 months-old due a ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation related to a septic event. Although difficult to diagnose, possibly most fetuses with TS1 have symptoms of long QT syndrome.

"Adverse drug reactions are among the leading causes of death. Pharmacovigilance aims to monitor drugs after they have been released to the market in order to detect potential risks. Data sources commonly used to this end are spontaneous reports sent in by doctors or pharmaceutical companies. Reports alone are rather limited when it comes to detecting potential health risks. Routine statutory health insurance data, however, are a richer source since they not only provide a detailed picture of the patients' wellbeing over time, but also contain information on concomitant medication and comorbidities.To take advantage of their potential and to increase drug safety, we will further develop statistical methods that have shown their merit in other fields as a source of inspiration.

"Clinical trials that led to ibrutinib's approval for the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia showed that its side effects differ from those of traditional chemotherapy. Reasons for discontinuation in clinical practice have not been adequately studied. We conducted a retrospective analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with ibrutinib either commercially or on clinical trials. We aimed to compare the type and frequency of toxicities reported in either setting, assess discontinuation rates, and evaluate outcomes. This multicenter, retrospective analysis included ibrutinib-treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients at nine United States cancer centers or from the Connect® Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Registry. We examined demographics, dosing, discontinuation rates and reasons, toxicities, and outcomes. The primary endpoint was progression-free survival. Six hundred sixteen ibrutinib-treated patients were identified. A total of 546 (88%) patients were treated with the commercial drug. Clinical trial patients were younger (mean age 58 <i>versus</i> 61 years, <i>P</i>=0.01) and had a similar time from diagnosis to treatment with ibrutinib (mean 85 <i>versus</i> 87 months, <i>P</i>=0.8). With a median follow-up of 17 months, an estimated 41% of patients discontinued ibrutinib (median time to ibrutinib discontinuation was 7 months). Notably, ibrutinib toxicity was the most common reason for discontinuation in all settings. The median progression-free survival and overall survival for the entire cohort were 35 months and not reached (median follow-up 17 months), respectively. In the largest reported series on ibrutinib- treated chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients, we show that 41% of patients discontinued ibrutinib. Intolerance as opposed to chronic lymphocytic leukemia progression was the most common reason for discontinuation. Outcomes remain excellent and were not affected by line of therapy or whether patients were treated on clinical studies or commercially. These data strongly argue in favor of finding strategies to minimize ibrutinib intolerance so that efficacy can be further maximized. Future clinical trials should consider time-limited therapy approaches, particularly in patients achieving a complete response, in order to minimize ibrutinib exposure.",29419429,Toxicities and outcomes of 616 ibrutinib-treated patients in the United States: a real-world analysis.,0,1
"Teratology is the study of anatomical and physiological abnormalities, commonly known as birth defects. If an embryo is exposed to a harmful substance, or teratogen, during the critical period of development, an ensuing malformation may occur. These malformations and their associated mechanisms are studied and analyzed in laboratory animals in order to prevent them from occurring in humans. Rodents such as rats and mice have commonly been used in such studies because of their similarity to humans. In 1959, James G. Wilson designed, developed, and tested a protocol on how to observe and analyze structural malformations in rodent fetuses, which included: external examination, skeletal evaluation, soft tissue analysis, and data collection/analysis. For standardization purposes, i.e., to normalize findings from one lab to another, it is important that this protocol be followed with precision. Although many years have passed since Wilson initially created this protocol, it is still widely used to this day, and only minor changes have been made to his instructions such as the chemical reagents used in the experiments and methods of analysis of the experimental data. Such testing has resulted in major advances in the dissemination of teratology information, including the identification of an increasing number of teratogens and the understanding of the pathogenesis of birth defects. While mechanistically birth defect prevention will include the understanding of individual genomes and pharmacogenomics, overall, morphological assessment will still be required as an integral part of birth defects research. As the interaction between teratogenic and genetic factors is better understood, it is anticipated that the incidence of most types of defects will substantially be reduced.",31069690,Assessment of Gross Fetal Malformations: The Modernized Wilson Technique and Skeletal Staining.,1,1
"Several groups of investigators have reported an increased incidence of congenital anomalies in patients with congenital hypothyroidism. Furthermore, in patients with congenital hypothyroidism and mutations in genes known to be involved in thyroid development, specific extra-thyroidal abnormalities have been observed. The goal of the present study was to gain insight in the types and patterns of morphological characteristics depending on the type of congenital hypothyroidism of thyroidal origin (CH-T). In 242 Dutch CH-T patients with a thyroid agenesis, a dystopic thyroid rudiment or a eutopic thyroid gland, we performed a careful physical examination of the body surface directed to visually detectable morphological abnormalities; results were compared to a group of 1,007 Dutch control subjects. The percentage of patients with one or more major abnormalities in the total CH-T cohort (33.1%) and in patients with CH-T dystopic thyroid (37.2%) was significantly higher than in the control population (21.8%; P < 0.001). Especially in the CH-T dystopic thyroid group specific major malformations (bilateral ear pits; oligodontia) were found more frequently. Also, the percentage of patients in the total CH-T group with one or more minor anomalies (96.3%) was significantly higher than in the control group (82.5%). The careful grouping of patients according to their CH-T etiology and the types and patterns in morphological findings may be helpful in the search for novel genes involved in thyroid development.",19367618,Morphological abnormalities in children with thyroidal congenital hypothyroidism.,1,0

"This work aims to estimate the degree of adverse drug reactions (ADR) for psychiatric medications from social media, including Twitter, Reddit, and LiveJournal. Advances in lightning-fast cluster computing was employed to process large scale data, consisting of 6.4 terabytes of data containing 3.8 billion records from all the media. Rates of ADR were quantified using the SIDER database of drugs and side-effects, and an estimated ADR rate was based on the prevalence of discussion in the social media corpora. Agreement between these measures for a sample of ten popular psychiatric drugs was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient, r, with values between 0.08 and 0.50. Word2vec, a novel neural learning framework, was utilized to improve the coverage of variants of ADR terms in the unstructured text by identifying syntactically or semantically similar terms. Improved correlation coefficients, between 0.29 and 0.59, demonstrates the capability of advanced techniques in machine learning to aid in the discovery of meaningful patterns from medical data, and social media data, at scale.",28495341,Estimation of the prevalence of adverse drug reactions from social media.,0,1

"Fanconi anemia (FA) is a genomic instability syndrome with predisposition to congenital abnormalities, bone marrow failure, and cancer. Classical and most frequent congenital abnormalities include all those seen in VACTERL-H association and those described under the PHENOS acronym. Pathogenic variants in at least 22 genes are associated with FA, which code for proteins that comprise the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway. We reviewed 187 publications and 1101 cases of FA in which the gene or complementation group was identified and analyzed those in whom physical findings were sought. We conducted genotype-phenotype analyses considering the specific gene, the location in the FA/BRCA DNA repair pathway, and the type of variant (null or hypomorphic) as exposures. The outcomes were the presence of any physical abnormality or specific categories of abnormalities. Seventy-nine percent of the patients had at least one physical abnormality. Pathogenic variants in FANCB, FANCD2, the ID complex and downstream genes were associated with several specific anomalies. Patients with biallelic or hemizygous null variants had a higher proportion of at least one abnormality, renal malformations, microcephaly, short stature and the combination of VACTERL-H compared with those with hypomorphic genotypes.

"Survivors of childhood cancer are at risk for treatment-related musculoskeletal late effects. Early detection and orthopedic intervention can help ameliorate musculoskeletal late effects and prevent subsequent complications. This systematic review summarizes the literature describing associations between cancer, its treatment, and musculoskeletal late effects. We searched PubMed and Web of Science for English language articles published between January 1970 and December 2012. The search was limited to investigations with at least 15 participants and conducted at least 2 years after completion of therapy for childhood, adolescent, or young adult cancer. Some late skeletal effects, including low bone mineral density, osteonecrosis, slipped capital femoral epiphyses, oncogenic rickets, and hormonerelated growth disturbances have been previously reviewed and were excluded, as were outcomes following amputation and limb-salvage procedures. Of 2347 references identified, 30 met inclusion criteria and were retained. An additional 54 studies that met inclusion criteria were found in reference lists of retained studies. Of 84 studies, 60 focused on associations between radiotherapy, six between chemotherapy, and 18 between surgery and musculoskeletal late effects. We found that younger age, higher radiation dosage, and asymmetric or partial bone radiation volume influences the effects of radiation on the musculoskeletal system. Methotrexate and vincristine are associated with long-term muscular strength and flexibility deficits. Laminectomy and chest wall resection are associated with spinal malalignment, and enucleation is associated with orbital deformities among survivors.

"Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare but serious disease. Caused by the JC virus (JCV), it occurs in individuals with weakened immune systems and is a potential adverse reaction for certain immunomodulatory drugs. The PML Consortium was created to find better methods to predict, prevent, and treat PML. The Consortium brought together the pharmaceutical industry with academic, regulatory, and patient communities to advance research and dialogue on PML through a not-for-profit, collaborative approach involving a grant program, scientific workshops and conferences, and disease awareness efforts. Over nearly a decade, the Consortium contributed to the PML and JCV fields by advancing research, scientific exchange, and awareness of PML. In addition to advancing knowledge and helping to build cross-sector consensus on research priorities, the Consortium's grant program filled a funding gap and brought new investigators into PML and JCV research. Additionally, the Consortium's workshops and conferences created platforms for exchange that drove dialogue on knowledge gaps and future research directions. The Consortium also contributed to the scientific knowledge base with two literature reviews, one on PML treatment studies and a second on T cell deficiencies as a risk factor for PML and the brain as a site for conversion of harmless JCV into a pathogenic virus. Finally, the Consortium addressed a significant information gap with its disease awareness website for healthcare professionals, patients, and caregivers. Beyond its impact on the PML and JCV fields, the PML Consortium is important because it provides a precedent for how the pharmaceutical industry, academic researchers, patient organizations, and government can work together to address rare diseases, in particular rare adverse events. This kind of collaboration could be replicated to speed progress in addressing other rare diseases and adverse events, with significant potential benefits for the scientific, medical, and patient communities.

"Surgical congenital malformations often represent years of treatment, large number of hospital stays, treatment procedures, and long-term functional sequels affecting patients' psychosocial functioning. Both functional defects and psychosocial difficulties that occur commonly in childhood may pass through adolescence on to adulthood. This overview presents reports published over the past 3 decades to elucidate the long-term psychosocial consequences of surgical congenital malformations. Literature searches conducted on PubMed database revealed that less than 1% of all the records of surgical congenital malformations described long-term psychosocial consequences, but with diverse findings. This inconsistency may be due to methodological differences or deficiencies; especially in study design, patient sampling, and methods. Most of the studies revealed that the functional deficits may have great impact on patients' mental health, psychosocial functioning, and QoL; both short- and long-term negative consequences. Factors other than functional problems, e.g., repeated anesthesia, multiple hospitalization, traumatic treatment procedures, and parental dysfunctioning, may also predict long-term mental health and psychosocial functioning. Through multidisciplinary approach, pediatric surgeons should also be aware of deficits in emotional and psychosocial functioning.

"Background The causality assessment of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) remains a challenge, and none of the different available method of causality assessment used for assessing adverse reactions has been universally accepted as the gold standard. Objective To examine the agreement and correlation among three broad approaches for causality assessment of ADRs viz. World Health Organization-Uppsala Monitoring Centre (WHO-UMC) system, Naranjo algorithm, and updated Logistic method. Setting ADR monitoring centre (AMC) of a tertiary care teaching hospital in India. Method A total of 230 cases of ADR from April 2017 to August 2017 were retrospectively analyzed by each of these three methods. The agreement among the different methods was calculated by Cohen's kappa (κ), and Spearman's correlation was used to find the correlation among these methods. Main outcome measures Cohen's kappa value and Spearman's correlation coefficient for comparison among the different methods. Results The Cohen's κ used for analyzing the agreement between WHO-UMC system and Naranjo algorithm was 0.45, between WHO-UMC system and updated Logistic method was 0.405, and between Naranjo algorithm and updated Logistic method was 0.606. The Spearman's correlation coefficient was 0.793 for Naranjo algorithm vs. updated Logistic method, 0.735 for WHO-UMC system vs. Naranjo algorithm, and 0.696 for WHO-UMC system vs. updated Logistic method.

"The teratogenic potential of leflunomide (LEF) in humans is still a matter of debate. We evaluated exposed pregnancies of our German Embryotox pharmacovigilance database.

Of 65 prospectively enrolled pregnancies 47 were exposed during the 1st trimester and 18 preconceptional. Wash-out therapy was confirmed in 25 pregnancies. There were 10 spontaneous abortions and 19 elective terminations. Among 39 live-born children (including twins) one major malformation was recorded. A separate analysis of our retrospective adverse drug reaction database revealed one LEF-exposed case having no malformations. Our findings provide further evidence that LEF is not a major human teratogen. However, an embryotoxic potential resulting in an increased miscarriage rate cannot be ruled out.

"Systems toxicology approaches have been used as important tools in the drug discovery and medicine quality control processes. The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and toxicity properties of cephalosporins with an aminothiazoyl ring at the C-7 position (CATRs). Cardiac toxicity of the compounds was assessed in zebrafish embryos, and it was determined that CATRs disturbed the formation and development of the heart in a dose-dependent manner. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to the heart were also identified by transcriptome analysis, and co-DEGs were obtained in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Several Gene Ontology (GO) terms and pathways that were enriched by DEGs were identified, and the most significantly enriched pathways were adrenergic signaling in cardiomyocytes, cardiac muscle contraction, and vascular smooth muscle contraction. Combined molecular docking results elucidated that cardiac toxicity mainly depends on the mother nucleus structure 7-aminocephalosporanic acid (7-ACA). The predicted absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion (ADME) profile suggests that there is a modification at the C-3 side chain of 7-ACA that could change the compound distribution in vivo. The 7-ACA mother nucleus is responsible for the CATRs induced cardiac toxicity, and the three DEGs (nppa, adra2c, and tnni1c) may potentially be utilized as novel biomarkers for CATRs. Our results show that zebrafish embryos may be used to reveal the pathways of cardiac toxicity and they play a vital role in drug safety assessments.",29596928,Cardiac safety evaluation in zebrafish and in silico ADME prediction of cephalosporins with an aminothiazoyl ring at the C-7 position.,1,1
"Congenital heart defects represent a characteristic part of several genetic syndromes associated with chromosomal abnormalities such as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome; many genes located in this locus, mainly TBX1, are candidate genes for congenital heart defects. In our cohort of 27 subjects with congenital heart defect, both karyotype analysis and Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) were performed. The TBX1 gene was sequenced in patients lacking chromosomal abnormalities. FISH analysis showed a de novo 22q11.2 deletion in two patients. The screening of TBX1 coding sequence identified a novel missense mutation c.569C > A (p.P190Q) in six unrelated patients and detected two associated known single nucleotide polymorphisms; the c.664C > T (rs2301558) in three patients and the c.420T > C (p.Phe140 Phe) (rs41298814) in one patient. Bioinformatic tools show that the novel missense mutation c.569C > A could modify the function and the stability of the TBX1 protein. The c.569C > A mutation was not found in 50 healthy controls.

"Purpose To document the imaging findings associated with congenital Zika virus infection as found in the Instituto de Pesquisa in Campina Grande State Paraiba (IPESQ) in northeastern Brazil, where the congenital infection has been particularly severe. Materials and Methods From June 2015 to May 2016, 438 patients were referred to the IPESQ for rash occurring during pregnancy or for suspected fetal central nervous system abnormality. Patients who underwent imaging at IPESQ were included, as well as those with documented Zika virus infection in fluid or tissue (n = 17, confirmed infection cohort) or those with brain findings suspicious for Zika virus infection, with intracranial calcifications (n = 28, presumed infection cohort). Imaging examinations included 12 fetal magnetic resonance (MR) examinations, 42 postnatal brain computed tomographic examinations, and 11 postnatal brain MR examinations. Images were reviewed by four radiologists, with final opinion achieved by means of consensus. Results Brain abnormalities seen in confirmed (n = 17) and presumed (n = 28) congenital Zika virus infections were similar, with ventriculomegaly in 16 of 17 (94%) and 27 of 28 (96%) infections, respectively; abnormalities of the corpus callosum in 16 of 17 (94%) and 22 of 28 (78%) infections, respectively; and cortical migrational abnormalities in 16 of 17 (94%) and 28 of 28 (100%) infections, respectively. Although most fetuses underwent at least one examination that showed head circumference below the 5th percentile, head circumference could be normal in the presence of severe ventriculomegaly (seen in three fetuses). Intracranial calcifications were most commonly seen at the gray matter-white matter junction, in 15 of 17 (88%) and 28 of 28 (100%) confirmed and presumed infections, respectively. The basal ganglia and/or thalamus were also commonly involved with calcifications in 11 of 17 (65%) and 18 of 28 (64%) infections, respectively. The skull frequently had a collapsed appearance with overlapping sutures and redundant skin folds and, occasionally, intracranial herniation of orbital fat and clot in the confluence of sinuses.

To overcome this gap in our understanding, we used optical coherence tomography (OCT), a nondestructive imaging modality capable of micrometer-scale resolution imaging, to rapidly and accurately map cardiovascular structure and hemodynamics in real time under physiological conditions. In this study, we exposed avian embryos to a single dose of alcohol/ethanol at gastrulation when the embryo is sensitive to the induction of birth defects. Late-stage hearts were analyzed using standard histological analysis with a focus on the atrio-ventricular valves. Early cardiac function was assayed using Doppler OCT, and structural analysis of the cardiac cushions was performed using OCT imaging. Our results indicated that ethanol-exposed embryos developed late-stage valvuloseptal defects. At early stages, they exhibited increased regurgitant flow and developed smaller atrio-ventricular cardiac cushions, compared with controls (uninjected and saline-injected embryos). The embryos also exhibited abnormal flexion/torsion of the body. Our evidence suggests that ethanol-induced alterations in early cardiac function have the potential to contribute to late-stage valve and septal defects, thus demonstrating that functional parameters may serve as early and sensitive gauges of cardiac normalcy and abnormalities.

"Drug-induced birth defects (teratogenesis) represent unique adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Not only is the ADR manifest in a subject other than the one for whom treatment is intended, but most teratogens can be identified only after a drug is marketed. We know little about fetal safety for most marketed drugs, and identification of potential teratogens uniquely requires that study designs consider issues related to the effects of specific drugs, specific defects, and specific gestational timing.",27037730,Research challenges for drug-induced birth defects.,1,1

"Drug-induced musculoskeletal disorders represent a broad clinical spectrum, from asymptomatic biological abnormalities to severe and even life-threatening diseases. Since an increasing number of drugs have been implicated in inducing rheumatic symptoms and/or syndromes, this review is not meant to be exhaustive, bearing in mind that the development of any musculoskeletal disorder should be considered as possibly related to a medication. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of the more frequent drug-induced musculoskeletal disorders. These include: (i) arthralgias and arthropathies, including chondropathies and inflammatory arthritis; (ii) connective tissue diseases, especially lupus-like syndromes; (iii) periarticular disorders, including tendinopathies, enthesopathies and frozen shoulder; (iii) bone diseases, such as osteoporosis, osteomalacia and osteonecrosis; and (iv) myopathies. Although virtually all drug classes may induce musculoskeletal disorders, a significant part of them are related to corticosteroids, vaccines, antibacterials and lipid-lowering agents. Knowledge of drug-induced musculoskeletal disorders avoids carrying out unnecessary investigations, and allows optimal management of the patients, i.e. early discontinuation of the offending agent, adequate treatment monitoring and/or intervention with appropriate preventive actions.",17194169,Drug-induced musculoskeletal disorders.,1,1
"Ventricular Septal Defect (VSD), the most common congenital heart defect, is characterized by a hole in the septum between the right and left ventricles. The pathogenesis of VSD is unknown in most clinical cases. There is a paucity of data relevant to epigenetic changes in VSD. The placenta is a fetal tissue crucial in cardiac development and a potentially useful surrogate for evaluating the development of heart tissue. To understand epigenetic mechanisms that may play a role in the development of VSD, genome-wide DNA methylation assay on placentas of 8 term subjects with isolated VSD and no known or suspected genetic syndromes and 10 unaffected controls was performed using the Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip assay. We identified a total of 80 highly accurate potential CpGs in 80 genes for detection of VSD; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC ROC) 1.0 with significant 95% CI (FDR) p-values < 0.05 for each individual locus. The biological processes and functions for many of these differentially methylated genes are previously known to be associated with heart development or disease, including cardiac ventricle development (HEY2, ISL1), heart looping (SRF), cardiac muscle cell differentiation (ACTC1, HEY2), cardiac septum development (ISL1), heart morphogenesis (SRF, HEY2, ISL1, HEYL), Notch signaling pathway (HEY2, HEYL), cardiac chamber development (ISL1), and cardiac muscle tissue development (ACTC1, ISL1). In addition, we identified 8 microRNAs that have the potential to be biomarkers for the detection of VSD including: miR-191, miR-548F1, miR-148A, miR-423, miR-92B, miR-611, miR-2110, and miR-548H4.

"The purpose of this study was to develop and validate estimate equations for preventing adverse drug reactions (ADRs). We conducted five case-control studies to identify individual risk factors and subjective symptoms associated with the following five ADRs: drug-induced ischemic heart disease; renal damage; muscle disorder; interstitial pneumonia; and leucopenia. We performed logistic regression analysis and obtained eight regression equations for each ADR. We converted these to ADR estimate equations for predicting the likelihood of ADRs. We randomly selected 50 cases with non-individual ADRs from the Case Reports of Adverse Drug Reactions and Poisoning Information System (CARPIS) database of over 65000 case reports of ADRs, and assigned these cases to a validation case group. We then calculated the predictive probability for 50 cases using the eight estimate equations for each ADR. The highest probability for each ADR was set as the probability of each ADR. If the probability was over 50%, the case was interpreted as ADR-positive. We calculated and evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and positive likelihood ratio of this system. Sensitivity of the estimate equations for muscle disorder and interstitial pneumonia were ≥90%. Specificity and positive likelihood ratios of estimate equations for renal damage, interstitial pneumonia and leucopenia were ≥80% and ≥5, respectively. Our estimate equations thus showed high validity, and are therefore helpful for the prevention or early detection of ADRs.",26135088,[Development and Validation of Estimate Equations for Adverse Drug Reactions Using Risk Factors and Subjective Symptoms].,0,0

"As thromboembolic events (TEE) are common in adults with congenital heart disease (ACHD), adequate oral anticoagulation for prophylaxis or treatment of TEE is important. Until now, mainly vitamin K antagonists have been used in these patients. The purpose of this study was to provide first data on the use of direct oral anticoagulants in ACHD. This prospective, observational, and longitudinal study included 102 consecutive ACHD, of whom 75 (37 women and 38 men; mean age 50 ± 13 years) could be analyzed. Most common CHD were pre-tricuspid shunts (n = 31; 41%), complex CHD (n = 16; 21%), left heart/aortic valve anomalies (n = 5; 6%), right-sided cardiac/pulmonary artery anomalies (n = 9; 13%), post-tricuspid shunts (n = 3; 4%), and others (n = 11; 15%). Five patients had cyanosis and 3 patients a Fontan circulation. Mean follow-up was 12 ± 11 months. Rivaroxaban was administered in 55 patients, apixaban in 13 and dabigatran in 7 patients for TEE prophylaxis in atrial arrhythmias (n = 57), stroke/transient ischemic attacks (n = 11), deep vein thrombosis (n = 4), pulmonary embolism (n = 1) and atrial thrombi (n = 3). Some patients had >1 indication for adequate oral anticoagulation. CHA2-DS2-VASc score was ≥ 2 in 23 (31%), and 9 (12%) had a HAS-BLED score ≥ 2.

"Congenital diaphragmatic hernias (CDHs) and structural anomalies of the diaphragm are a common class of congenital birth defects that are associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to associated pulmonary hypoplasia, pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. In ∼30% of CDH patients, genomic analyses have identified a range of genetic defects, including chromosomal anomalies, copy number variants and sequence variants. The affected genes identified in CDH patients include transcription factors, such as <i>GATA4</i>, <i>ZFPM2</i>, <i>NR2F2</i> and <i>WT1</i>, and signaling pathway components, including members of the retinoic acid pathway. Mutations in these genes affect diaphragm development and can have pleiotropic effects on pulmonary and cardiac development. New therapies, including fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion and prenatal transplacental fetal treatments, aim to normalize lung development and pulmonary vascular tone to prevent and treat lung hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension, respectively. Studies of the association between particular genetic mutations and clinical outcomes should allow us to better understand the origin of this birth defect and to improve our ability to predict and identify patients most likely to benefit from specialized treatment strategies.",28768736,Congenital diaphragmatic hernias: from genes to mechanisms to therapies.,1,0

"Fatal cardiac arrhythmias, known as torsades de pointes, can occur with a wide variety of medicinal drugs and are associated with prolongation of the QT interval. This review critically evaluates the major strategies for assessing QT prolongation risk: ion channel studies, in vitro cardiac electrophysiology, and in vivo cardiac electrophysiology and hemodynamics. Disease- or drug-induced QT prolongation is mainly associated with reduced amplitude of the repolarizing outward K+ current in myocardial cells, particularly those carried by the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) channel. Thus, measuring HERG currents using patch-clamp technology and cloned HERG channels represents a first approach for evaluating adverse effects of drugs on ion channel function, under physiological conditions. Evaluation of changes in transmembrane action potential in isolated rabbit or dog Purkinje fibers reflects mixed ion channel blocking properties of the test substance and therefore permits a greater understanding of the mechanisms underlying the genesis of arrhythmias. Both HERG channel and Purkinje fiber procedures are clinically predictive, however, no in vitro technique can fully reproduce the in vivo situation. Therefore, both in vitro and in vivo approaches should be employed to maximize the chances of an accurate assessment of risk in an area where prolonged QT can result in death.",12735231,QT interval prolongation and cardiac risk assessment for novel drugs.,1,1

"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is a chronic and heterogeneous intestinal inflammatory disorder. The medical management of IBD aims for long-lasting disease remission to prevent complications and disease progression. Early introduction of immunosuppression forms the mainstay of medical IBD management. Large inter-individual variability in drug responses, in terms of both efficacy and toxicity, leads to high rates of therapeutic failure in the management of IBD. Better patient stratification is needed to maximize patient benefit and minimize the harm caused by adverse events. Pre-treatment pharmacogenetic testing has the potential to optimize drug selection and dose, and to minimize harm caused by adverse drug reactions. In addition, optimizing the use of cheap conventional drugs, and avoiding expensive ineffective drugs, will lead to a significant reduction in costs. Genetic variation in both <i>TPMT</i> and <i>NUDT15</i>, genes involved in thiopurine metabolism, is associated to an increased risk of thiopurine-induced myelosuppression. Moreover, specific <i>HLA</i> haplotypes confer risk to thiopurine-induced pancreatitis and to immunogenicity to tumor necrosis factor-antagonists, respectively. Falling costs and increased availability of genetic tests allow for the incorporation of pre-treatment genetic tests into clinical IBD management guidelines. In this paper, we review clinically useful pharmacogenetic associations for individualized treatment of patients with IBD and discuss the path from identification of a predictive pharmacogenetic marker to implementation into IBD clinical care.",31210708,Predicting (side) effects for patients with inflammatory bowel disease: The promise of pharmacogenetics.,0,1

Incidence of acute and prevalence of chronic maternal diseases in the mothers with IECA and in the mothers of their matched controls and all controls without any defects, in addition in the mothers of malformed controls with other isolated defects was compared in the population-based large dataset of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities. Of 354 cases with IECA, 32 had mothers with high fever related influenza-common cold during the critical period of IECA and it resulted in a higher risk of IECA in their live-born infants (adjusted OR with 95% CI: 4.3, 1.9-7.4) compared with their matched controls. However, the early and effective antifever treatment in these pregnant women prevented them from the IECA. In addition there was an association of maternal otitis media with higher risk of complex defects of middle and external ears (OR with 95% CI: 5.2, 1.6-28.3), however, this association was based on 4 cases only.

We conducted a case-control study evaluating 52,955 cases with birth defects and 642,399 controls born between 1999 and 2011 to investigate the relationship between UNGD exposure and the risk of gastroschisis, congenital heart defects (CHD), neural tube defects (NTDs), and orofacial clefts in Texas. We calculated UNGD densities (number of UNGDs per area) within 1, 3, and 7.5 km of maternal address at birth and categorized exposure by density tertiles. For CHD subtypes with large case numbers, we also performed time-stratified analyses to examine temporal trends. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for the association with UNGD exposure, accounting for maternal characteristics and neighborhood factors. We also included a bivariable smooth of geocoded maternal location in an additive model to account for unmeasured spatially varying risk factors. Positive associations were observed between the highest tertile of UNGD density within 1 km of maternal address and risk of anencephaly (aOR: 2.44, 95% CI: 1.55, 3.86), spina bifida (aOR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.47, 2.99), gastroschisis among older mothers (aOR: 3.19, 95% CI: 1.77, 5.73), aortic valve stenosis (aOR: 1.90, 95% CI: 1.33, 2.71), hypoplastic left heart syndrome (aOR: 2.00, 95% CI: 1.39, 2.86), and pulmonary valve atresia or stenosis (aOR: 1.36, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.66). For CHD subtypes, results did not differ substantially by distance from maternal address or when residual confounding was considered, except for atrial septal defects.

Fetuses were assigned to the isolated EIF and non-isolated EIF groups according to the presence of other ultrasound abnormalities.Among 244 pregnant women, there were 143 cases of isolated EIF and 101 of non-isolated EIF. CMA revealed chromosome abnormality (n = 9 (3.7%): trisomy 21, n = 4; sexual trisomy, n = 2; and p-CNV, n = 3), variants of unknown significance (VOUS, n = 19), and benign CNV (b-CNV, n = 216). Among the fetuses with isolated EIF, 5 had chromosomal abnormalities (3.5%). Among the fetuses with non-isolated EIF, four had chromosomal abnormalities (4.0%). All fetuses with trisomy 21 were in the non-isolated group. The frequency of labor induction was 66.7% (6/9) among the fetuses with chromosome abnormality and 21.1% (4/19) among those with VOUS.

"OBJECTIVE To determine predictors of perioperative allogeneic packed red blood cell (pRBC) transfusion requirement (total units transfused) in patients with adult spinal deformity (ASD). METHODS The authors retrospectively analyzed records of patients aged 18 years or older who underwent surgical correction of ASD that involved 4 or more spinal levels by the same spine surgeon between 2010 and 2016. Data regarding patient characteristics, comorbidities, surgical factors, and perioperative transfusions (up to 10 days after surgery) were analyzed using a linear regression model. Significance was set at p < 0.05. RESULTS The authors analyzed 165 patients (118 women) with a mean (± SD) age of 61 ± 12 years. Three-column osteotomies were associated with a mean intraoperative transfusion volume of 1.74 additional units of pRBCs. Each unit of intraoperatively salvaged blood used was associated with a mean 0.39-U increase in postoperative transfusion volume (p = 0.031). Every unit of allogeneic blood transfused intraoperatively was associated with a mean 0.23-U decrease in postoperative transfusion volume (p = 0.001). A preoperative hemoglobin concentration of 11.5 g/dl or more was associated with significantly fewer units transfused intraoperatively; a preoperative hemoglobin concentration of 14.0 g/dl or more was associated with fewer units transfused postoperatively. A history of smoking and intraoperative antifibrinolytic use were associated with increased and decreased numbers of units transfused postoperatively, respectively. CONCLUSIONS Effective blood management is key to perioperative care of patients with ASD. Three-column osteotomies were associated with a greater number of units of blood transfused. When considering postoperative transfusion requirements, surgeons should note that intraoperative blood salvage might be inferior to intraoperative allogeneic blood transfusion. Using antifibrinolytics and increasing the preoperative hemoglobin concentration to 11.5 g/dl or more are strategies for decreasing the need for perioperative transfusion. A history of smoking is a risk factor for postoperative transfusion requirement (total units transfused).",29350594,Determinants of perioperative transfusion risk in patients with adult spinal deformity.,0,0

Goats from Group 1 received fresh P. pyramidalis, harvested daily, as the only roughage during the whole breeding and pregnancy period. Goats in Group 2 (control) received Cynodon dactylon (tifton) hay free choice. Ultrasound examination for pregnancy diagnosis was performed every 28 days. Four goats from Group 1 were pregnant on day 28 but not on day 56, suggesting embryonic death or abortion. Another goat from Group 1 died at day 70 of pregnancy, and the fetuses exhibited micrognathia. The other three goats bore six kids, three of which showed bone malformations in the limbs, spine, ribs, sternum, and head, including arthrogryposis, scoliosis and micrognathia. One kid also showed hypoplasia of the left pulmonary lobes. In the control group, all goats bore a total of 13 kids and none of them exhibited malformations. These results demonstrated that P. pyramidalis causes congenital malformations and other reproductive losses in goats.

"Registries of congenital malformations were implemented in many industrialized countries following the drama of thalidomide. In 2013, four French registries of congenital malformations in France provide the systematic epidemiological surveillance of birth defects. All are part of international networks of registries, especially European surveillance of congenital anomalies (EUROCAT). If the development of prevention actions including prenatal diagnosis has gradually led the registries to play a key role of assessment on the impact of public health policies, one of the major roles of registries of congenital malformations remains early detection of clusters of malformations secondary to teratogenic effects.

"The common cold is the most frequent maternal disease during pregnancy. The possible association between different congenital abnormalities and the common cold in pregnant women was evaluated in the data set of the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities between 1980 and 1996. Of 22,843 cases with congenital abnormalities, 3,827 (16.8%) had mothers with the common cold, while of 38,151 population controls without congenital abnormalities, 5,475 (14.4%) (adjusted prevalence odds ratio: POR: 1.26 with 95% CI: 1.20-1.32). Of 834 malformed controls with Down syndrome, 114 (17.3%) had mothers with the common cold (POR: 0.96 with 95% CI: 0.80-1.16). Nearly half of mothers with the common cold had secondary complications with antifever therapy. The comparison of cases with 25 congenital abnormalities and population control mothers with medically recorded common cold during the second and third months of gestation showed that five congenital abnormality groups: congenital hydrocephaly (3.6, 1.3-9.7), cleft lip+/-palate (2.3, 1.5-3.6), posterior cleft palate (2.3, 1.2-4.1), limb deficiencies (2.2, 1.1-4.1) and multiple CAs (2.0, 1.4-2.9) had adjusted POR 2 or more. The comparison of cases with different congenital abnormalities and malformed controls (including offspring with Down syndrome) as referent, indicated a higher prevalence of the common cold during the second and third month of gestation only in the mothers of cases with cleft lip+/-palate (adjusted POR: 1.7 with 95% CI: 1.2-2.5), however, congenital hydrocephaly, neural-tube defects and multiple CAs had also mothers with a somewhat higher occurrence of the common cold. The possible association between the common cold during early pregnancy and the above mentioned congenital abnormalities may be connected mainly with the indirect effect of secondary complications of maternal common cold, particularly high fever because antifever drugs were able to prevent the possible teratogenic effect of the common cold.",16450209,Population-based case-control study of the common cold during pregnancy and congenital abnormalities.,1,0
"Diamond-Blackfan anemia (DBA) is a congenital pure red blood cell aplasia diagnosed in the first year of life. Familiarity is apparent in 10% of patients, with all other cases being sporadic. Physical abnormalities are present in at least one third of patients, pointing to a defect in early embryo development. The main clinical sign is profound isolated anemia, with normal numbers and functioning of the other hemopoietic cells. Reticulocyte counts are very low. Bone marrow reflects defective erythropoiesis, showing a very low number of erythropoietic precursors and a reduction of BFU-E progenitor cells. Proliferation and differentiation of the other lineages are normal. The very high erythropoietin (EPO) levels are usually not proportionate to the level of anemia and reflect relative EPO insensitivity, which is also apparent in vitro. Conversely, erythroid progenitors from DBA patients also show a defective or incomplete response to other erythropoietic growth factors, such as IL-3 or IL-6. A significant response has been observed in vitro to stem cell factor in many, but not all patients. Many patients respond clinically to corticosteroids and some develop hematologic remissions, both after corticosteroids and spontaneously. Patients who do not respond to corticosteroids and those who have to discontinue treatment because of side effects must rely on chronic transfusion and are thus exposed to all its complications. Bone marrow transplantation has been performed in some individuals, usually with a successful outcome. This suggests a normal marrow microenvironment and rules out the hypothesis of defective stromal cell function. The variable clinical and biological patterns may be the expression of multiple etiologies or represent variable expressivity of a single genetic defect. Only identification of the responsible gene(s) will solve this question. Growth factors exerting an effect on erythropoiesis (and relative receptors) or transacting proteins which regulate their expression are likely candidates in the hunt for a causal gene.",9009445,Diamond-Blackfan anemia: a congenital defect in erythropoiesis.,1,1

"Although montelukast is generally well tolerated, postmarketing studies have reported serious neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions (ADRs) leading to a United States Food and Drug Administration black box warning. The objective of this study was to determine the incidence of neuropsychiatric ADRs leading to discontinuation of montelukast in asthmatic children.We conducted a retrospective cohort study in children aged 1-17 years initiated on montelukast. In a nested cohort study, children initiated on montelukast as monotherapy or adjunct therapy to inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) were matched to those initiated on ICS monotherapy. A non-leading parental interview served to ascertain the occurrence of any ADRs with any asthma medication, and circumstances related to, and evolution of, the event.Out of the 106 participants who initiated montelukast, most were male (58%), Caucasian (62%) with a median (interquartile range) age of 5 (3-8) years. The incidence (95% CI) of drug cessation due to neuropsychiatric ADRs was 16 (10-26)%, mostly occurring within 2 weeks. Most frequent ADRs were irritability, aggressiveness and sleep disturbances. The relative risk of neuropsychiatric ADRs associated with montelukast <i>versus</i> ICS was 12 (2-90).In the real-life setting, asthmatic children initiated on montelukast experienced a notable risk of neuropsychiatric ADRs leading to drug cessation, that is significantly higher than that associated with ICS.",28818882,Neuropsychiatric adverse drug reactions in children initiated on montelukast in real-life practice.,0,1

"PureSorb-Q40 (water-soluble type CoQ10 powder, CoQ10 content is 40 w/w%; hereinafter referred to as P40) is reported in the single-dose human and rat studies to have a greater absorption rate and absorbed volume of CoQ10 even taken postprandially, than those of regular CoQ10, which is lipid-soluble and generally taken in the form of soft-gel capsules. Thus, it was anticipated that the serum CoQ10 level might be higher with P40 tablets than with soft-gel capsules, even for the same dose of CoQ10. In the present study, in order to confirm the safety and measure the serum CoQ10 level for the case of an excessive dose of P40, a double-blinded Placebo controlled comparative study was conducted on 46 healthy volunteers and they were randomly divided into two groups. The P40 tablets or placebo were repeatedly taken by the volunteers. As the result of the study, for the group of taking 2250 mg/d of P40 (that is, 900 mg/d of CoQ10) for 4 consecutive wk, the serum CoQ10 level peaked at 2 wk after the start of intake at 8.79 +/- 3.34 microg/mL, and at 4 wk, it was at the level of 8.33 +/- 4.04 microg/mL. At 2 wk from withdrawal of intake, the serum CoQ10 level decreased to 1.30 +/- 0.49 microg/mL. The serum CoQ10 levels at these three points were significantly higher than those of the first day of intake and the Placebo group, which had no significant change throughout the study. Furthermore, P40 intake did not cause any significant changes in symptoms or clinical laboratory results as assessed by physical, hematological, blood biochemical or urinalysis tests. Physician examinations also did not reveal any abnormalities.

"Prediction of adverse drug reactions is an important problem in drug discovery endeavors which can be addressed with data-driven strategies. SIDER is one of the most reliable and frequently used datasets for identification of key features as well as building machine learning models for side effects prediction. The inherently unbalanced nature of this data presents with a difficult multi-label multi-class problem towards prediction of drug side effects. We highlight the intrinsic issue with SIDER data and methodological flaws in relying on performance measures such as AUC while attempting to predict side effects.We argue for the use of metrics that are robust to class imbalance for evaluation of classifiers. Importantly, we present a 'hierarchical anatomical classification schema' which aggregates side effects into organs, sub-systems, and systems. With the help of a weighted performance measure, using 5-fold cross-validation we show that this strategy facilitates biologically meaningful side effects prediction at different levels of anatomical hierarchy. By implementing various machine learning classifiers we show that Random Forest model yields best classification accuracy at each level of coarse-graining. The manually curated, hierarchical schema for side effects can also serve as the basis of future studies towards prediction of adverse reactions and identification of key features linked to specific organ systems. Our study provides a strategy for hierarchical classification of side effects rooted in the anatomy and can pave the way for calibrated expert systems for multi-level prediction of side effects.",29494708,A hierarchical anatomical classification schema for prediction of phenotypic side effects.,0,0

"The authors hypothesized that changes in prenatal factors such as termination of pregnancy for fetal anomalies and prenatal vitamin supplementation have altered the epidemiology of patients with multiple congenital anomalies and may have had an impact on their prevalence in the current era. This study reviewed the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database from 1998 to 2008 and compared the prevalence of ECM among live births with a CHD diagnosis (case) and that among live births without a CHD diagnosis (control). For this study, 42 ECM and 10 CHD diagnoses were selected for subanalysis. Longitudinal analysis also was performed to determine temporal variation of ECM prevalence in the CHD population during the 11-year study period. The cohort in this study consisted of 97,154 patients in the case group and 12,078,482 subjects in the control group. The prevalences in the CHD population were 11.4 % for nonsyndromic congenital malformation (NSCM), 2.2 % for genetic syndrome (GS), and 13.6 % for overall extracardiac congenital malformation (ECM). The prevalences in the control group were 6.7 % for NSCM, 0.3 % for GS, and 7.0 % for ECM. The findings showed a strong association of NSCM [odds ratio (OR) 1.88; 95 % confidence interval (CI) 1.73-1.94], GS (OR 2.52; 95 % CI 2.44-2.61), and overall ECM (OR 2.01; 95 % CI 1.97-2.14) with CHD.

"Venous malformations (VMs) are often painful and may enlarge over time. Chronic coagulopathy is common in VMs and may contribute to phleboliths and potentially to disease progression. Few studies have examined the effects of anticoagulation on VMs and to our knowledge none have examined the use of aspirin therapy. A survey was administered to patients and parents of patients with VMs who attended the University of California at San Francisco Vascular Anomalies Center over a 4-year period (2008-2012) to whom aspirin had been recommended. They were surveyed regarding whether they were taking aspirin and, if yes, whether aspirin had resulted in any appreciable benefit. Sixty-five letters were sent to potential subjects: 38 participated and 27 declined to participate or could not be contacted. Twenty-eight of the 38 had begun aspirin and 22 reported current use. Seventeen reported some benefit, including less aching (n = 2), less shooting pain (n = 15), less fullness and swelling (n = 13), and shrinking of the VM (n = 1). Discontinuation of aspirin was associated with worsening VM symptoms in five of six patients. Side effects were reported in 6 of 28 patients, including five episodes of minor bleeding or excessive bruising and one of nausea and vomiting. This study suggests that aspirin may be a beneficial treatment for VM, with a reduction in pain and soft tissue swelling and an acceptable side-effect profile, but the retrospective nature of the study and the small size of the cohort limited our conclusions. Larger prospective studies of aspirin for VM using clinical and laboratory outcome measures are needed to confirm these observations.",25040175,"Aspirin therapy in venous malformation: a retrospective cohort study of benefits, side effects, and patient experiences.",1,1
"Nucleoporins (NUPs) are an essential component of the nuclear-pore complex, which regulates nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Pathogenic variants in NUP genes have been linked to several inherited human diseases, including a number with progressive neurological degeneration. We present six affected individuals with bi-allelic truncating variants in NUP188 and strikingly similar phenotypes and clinical courses, representing a recognizable genetic syndrome; the individuals are from four unrelated families. Key clinical features include congenital cataracts, hypotonia, prenatal-onset ventriculomegaly, white-matter abnormalities, hypoplastic corpus callosum, congenital heart defects, and central hypoventilation. Characteristic dysmorphic features include small palpebral fissures, a wide nasal bridge and nose, micrognathia, and digital anomalies. All affected individuals died as a result of respiratory failure, and five of them died within the first year of life. Nuclear import of proteins was decreased in affected individuals' fibroblasts, supporting a possible disease mechanism. CRISPR-mediated knockout of NUP188 in Drosophila revealed motor deficits and seizure susceptibility, partially recapitulating the neurological phenotype seen in affected individuals. Removal of NUP188 also resulted in aberrant dendrite tiling, suggesting a potential role of NUP188 in dendritic development. Two of the NUP188 pathogenic variants are enriched in the Ashkenazi Jewish population in gnomAD, a finding we confirmed with a separate targeted population screen of an international sampling of 3,225 healthy Ashkenazi Jewish individuals.

"Mothers with a CYP2D6 ultrarapid metabolizer phenotype may expose their infants to risk of adverse events when taking codeine while breastfeeding, by producing more of the active metabolite, morphine. Pharmacogenetic testing may be a valuable tool to identify such mothers, but testing can be costly. The objective of the study was to determine the incremental costs of genotyping to avert neonatal adverse events during maternal pharmacotherapy. A cost-effectiveness analysis, using a decision model, was performed with a hypothetical cohort of prenatal subjects. Parameter estimates, costs and ranges for sensitivity analyses were ascertained from the literature and expert opinion. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the results. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis revealed an incremental cost-effectiveness (ICER) of $10 433 (Canadian dollars) for genotyping compared to no genotyping per adverse event averted. Results were sensitive to hospital admission costs. The ICER was lower when evaluating only subjects having caesarean deliveries or those from ethnic populations known to have a high prevalence of ultra-rapid metabolizers.

Most studies with significant findings were those investigating the risk potential of one group of drugs, the anticonvulsants. The lack of cohort studies showing a risk for drug use in pregnancy, however, is not necessarily indicative of some methodological deficiency.

The distribution was made up of 34.6% children with ventricular septal defect, 15.9% with atrial septal defect, 9.8% with patency of arterial duct, 4.9% with pulmonary valvar stenosis, 3.3% with tetralogy of Fallot, 3.3% with transposed great arteries, 3.3% with aortic stenosis, 3.2% with aortic coarctation, 4.3% with atrioventricular septal defect and common atrioventricular orifice, 2.3% with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, and 8.3% other with severe defects. The average age in the time of diagnoses is 70.41 days (SD, 188.13), with low average time of diagnoses of severe heart defects, 9.6 days (SD, 32.52). Among patients, 14.5% had chromosomal defects, syndromes, and/or other congenital major anomalies. During the study, 57 patients died because of cardiac anomalies or other related problems, 24 who died were operated. The rates of specific cardiac defects and association with extracardiac malformations are generally comparable with those reported in similar studies.

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs), unintended and sometimes dangerous effects that a drug may have, are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality during medical care. To date, there is no structured machine-readable authoritative source of known ADRs. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) partnered with the National Library of Medicine to create a pilot dataset containing standardised information about known adverse reactions for 200 FDA-approved drugs. The Structured Product Labels (SPLs), the documents FDA uses to exchange information about drugs and other products, were manually annotated for adverse reactions at the mention level to facilitate development and evaluation of text mining tools for extraction of ADRs from all SPLs. The ADRs were then normalised to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) and to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). We present the curation process and the structure of the publicly available database SPL-ADR-200db containing 5,098 distinct ADRs. The database is available at https://bionlp.nlm.nih.gov/tac2017adversereactions/; the code for preparing and validating the data is available at https://github.com/lhncbc/fda-ars.",29381145,A dataset of 200 structured product labels annotated for adverse drug reactions.,0,1
"Background Chylothorax following cardiothoracic surgery is a rare condition in pediatric patients with significant morbidity and mortality. Pharmacological management with octreotide suggests possible efficacy; however, current evidence is inadequate. The objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of octreotide as a therapeutic option in this clinical setting. Methods This was a 12-year single-center retrospective cohort study of all patients (birth to 18-years old) who received octreotide for management of post-cardiac surgery chylothorax between January 2003 to August 2015. The primary efficacy endpoint was resolution of chylothorax, categorized as complete (<2 mL·kg<sup>-1</sup>·day<sup>-1</sup>), partial (based on physician's judgement), or failed. The primary safety endpoint was any significant adverse drug reaction leading to discontinuation of octreotide therapy. Of the 46 patients identified as receiving octreotide for post-cardiac surgery chylothorax, 29 were included in efficacy and safety analyses. Results Resolution of chylothorax was achieved in 62% (complete in 28%, partial in 34%) of the total sample. The 38% who did not respond to octreotide therapy required thoracic duct ligation. The mean initial dose and duration of octreotide was 4 ± 3 µg·kg<sup>-1</sup>·h<sup>-1</sup> and 10 ± 5 days, respectively. Besides minor side-effects including transient hyperglycemia (45%), abdominal distension (3%), and tachycardia (>150 beats·min<sup>-1</sup>; 10%), no patient developed a significant side-effect that required discontinuation of therapy.

"We studied the incidence of fatal adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in a tertiary hospital to find out which drugs were involved. The secondary objective was to compare the data from the same hospital published 12 years earlier. All 1708 death cases in the Helsinki University Central Hospital during the year 2012 were retrospectively evaluated. All suspected drug-related deaths, excluding suicides, were scrutinized by an expert panel using the WHO ADR probability classification. Of all cases, 52 (3.0%) were classified as certainly or probably drug related and 24 (1.4%) as possibly drug related. Together, these corresponded to 0.02% of all hospital admissions. The most commonly involved drugs in certain or probable cases were cytostatics (18 cases, 1.1% of all cases) and antithrombotics (17, 1.0%). Twelve years earlier, these caused 27 (1.8%) and 22 (1.5%) cases, respectively. Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and glucocorticoids caused less (2 and 0 cases) fatal ADRs than earlier (12 and 4 cases, p = 0.048 and p = 0.005, respectively). Most of the ADRs leading to death were present already in admission and affected seriously ill or elderly patients. Hospital-born fatal ADRs occurred in 0.003% of patients. In conclusion, cytostatics and antithrombotics are still the leading causes of fatal ADRs, but NSAIDs and glucocorticoids seem to cause fatal ADRs less often than previously. The incidence of fatal ADRs in 2012 was 3.0% of all deaths, suggesting a decline compared to the 2000 value (5.0%). Improved awareness, prevention and treatment of ADRs and safer medicines may explain these declining trends.

"We investigated factors affecting the timing of signal detection by comparing variations in reporting time of known and unknown ADRs after initial drug release in the USA. Data on adverse event reactions (AERs) submitted to U.S. FDA was used. Six ADRs associated with 6 drugs (rosuvastatin, aripiprazole, teriparatide, telithromycin, exenatide, varenicline) were investigated: Changes in the proportional reporting ratio, reporting odds ratio, and information component as indexes of signal detection were followed every 3 months after each drugs release, and the time for detection of signals was investigated. The time for the detection of signal to be detected after drug release in the USA was 2-10 months for known ADRs and 19-44 months for unknown ones. The median lag time for known and unknown ADRs was 99.0-122.5 days and 185.5-306.0 days, respectively. When the FDA released advisory information on rare but potentially serious health risks of an unknown ADR, the time lag to report from the onset of ADRs to the FDA was shorter. This study suggested that one factor affecting signal detection time is whether an ADR was known or unknown at release.

"Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) persistence is associated, in prematures, to several complications. The optimal PDA management is still under debate, especially regarding the best therapeutic approach and the time to treat. The available drugs are not exempt from contraindications and side effects; ibuprofen itself, although representing the first-choice therapy, can show nephrotoxicity and other complications. Paracetamol seems a valid alternative to classic nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory Drugs, with a lower toxicity. Areas covered: Through an analysis of the published literature on ibuprofen and paracetamol effects in preterm neonates, this review compares the available treatments for PDA, analyzing the mechanisms underlining ibuprofen-associated nephrotoxicity and the eventual paracetamol-induced hepatic damage, also providing an update of what has been yet demonstrated and a clear description of the still open issues. Expert Opinion: Paracetamol is an acceptable alternative in case of contraindication to ibuprofen; its toxicity, in this setting, is very low. Lower doses may be effective, with even fewer risks. In the future, paracetamol could represent an efficacious first-line therapy, although its safety, optimal dosage, and global impact have to be fully clarified through long-term trials, also in the perspective of an individualized and person-based therapy taking into account the extraordinary individual variability.",29938546,The dark side of ibuprofen in the treatment of patent ductus arteriosus: could paracetamol be the solution?,1,1

"Congenital lung lesions are common sonographic findings in pregnancy, usually detected at the routine 20 weeks scan. The most common is cystic adenomatous malformation of the lung (CCAM). This usually causes few prenatal problems; however, fetal hydrops occurs in about 5%. Prenatal intervention for these is possible in many to allow survival to birth. Bronchoplumonary sequestration (BPS), with an aberrant ""feeder"" vessel arising from the aorta may co-exist but is detectable as a separate entity by visualization of this vessel. Symptomatic or curative prenatal intervention is again possible in the few severe cases where hydrops or pleural effusions develop. Pleural effusions may be due to a primary leak usually of chylous fluid: prenatal thoracoamniotic shunting may prevent pulmonary hyoplasia or cure the consequent fetal hydrops. More often, however, effusions are a consequence of an underlying abnormality, including many structural or chromosomal abnormalities that may also cause co-existing fetal hydrops.

"The autosomal, recessively inherited, adducted thumb-clubfoot syndrome (ATCS) represents a generalized connective tissue disorder with congenital malformations, contractures of thumbs and feet, and a typical facial appearance. Cognitive development is normal in ATCS patients during childhood. ATCS is caused by homozygous nonsense and missense mutations in CHST14 which encodes an N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O-sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST1) that catalyzes the 4-O-sulfation of N-acetylgalactosamine in the repeating iduronic acid-alpha-1,3-N-acetylgalactosamine disaccharide sequence to form dermatan sulfate (DS). ATCS mutations lead to either a decrease or a loss of D4ST1 activity, as revealed by absence of DS and an excess of chondroitin sulfate (CS) in patient's fibroblasts. Either of these effects or their combination might cause the observed clinical symptoms by altering the physiological pattern of dermatan and CS chains on their corresponding proteoglycans (PGs). ATCS is the only recognized disorder resulting from a defect that is specific to DS biosynthesis, and thus represents another class of the congenital glycosylation disorders. Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) include all genetic diseases that result from defects in the synthesis of glycans. These disorders cause a wide range of human diseases, with examples emanating from all medical subspecialties.

"This study examines the ability of nonclinical adverse event observations to predict human clinical adverse events observed in drug development programs. In addition it examines the relationship between nonclinical and clinical adverse event observations to drug withdrawal and proposes a model to predict drug withdrawal based on these observations. These analyses provide risk assessments useful for both planning patient safety programs, as well as a statistical framework for assessing the future success of drug programs based on nonclinical and clinical observations. Bayesian analyses were undertaken to investigate the connection between nonclinical adverse event observations and observations of that same event in clinical trial for a large set of approved drugs. We employed the same statistical methods used to evaluate the efficacy of diagnostic tests to evaluate the ability of nonclinical studies to predict adverse events in clinical studies, and adverse events in both to predict drug withdrawal. We find that some nonclinical observations suggest higher risk for observing the same adverse event in clinical studies, particularly arrhythmias, QT prolongation, and abnormal hepatic function. However the lack of these events in nonclinical studies is found to not be a good predictor of safety in humans. Some nonclinical and clinical observations appear to be associated with high risk of drug withdrawal from market, especially arrhythmia and hepatic necrosis. We use the method to estimate the overall risk of drug withdrawal from market using the product of the risks from each nonclinical and clinical observation to create a risk profile.

A 12-year-old boy presented with long-term left-sided conductive hearing loss, and was found to have mallear fixation and a dehiscent facial nerve on a computed tomographic (CT) scan of the temporal bone. Release of the malleus was performed at surgery, revealing hypermobility of the remaining ossicular chain. A repeat CT scan of the temporal bone showed successful release of the mallear head. The patient's father later presented with bilateral hearing loss, and a CT scan of the temporal bones showed bilateral osseous fixation of the mallear head to the tegmen and bilateral facial nerve dehiscences. He underwent right middle ear exploration, but release of the malleus was not performed because of the risk to the dehiscent facial nerve. The stapes crurae were found to be filiform at surgery.

"Thalidomide is a drug used worldwide for several indications, but the molecular mechanisms of its teratogenic property are not fully understood. Studies in animal models suggest the oxidative stress, the inhibition of angiogenesis, and the binding to E3-ubiquitin ligase complex as mechanisms by which thalidomide can change the expression of genes important to embryonic development. In this study, seven polymorphisms in genes related to development (FGF8, FGF10, BMP4, SHH, TP53, TP63, and TP73) were analyzed in people with thalidomide embryopathy (TE) and compared to people without malformations. The sample consisted of 36 people with TE and 135 unrelated and nonsyndromic people who had their DNA genotyped by PCR real-time. Although no allelic or genotypic differences were observed between the groups, we hypothesized that other regions in these genes and related genes may play an important role in thalidomide teratogenesis, which is known to have a genetic contribution. Identifying such molecular mechanisms is essential for the development of a molecule that will be analogue to thalidomide but safe enough to avoid the emergence of new cases of TE.",29193903,Genetic susceptibility to thalidomide embryopathy in humans: Study of candidate development genes.,1,1

"Ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VT) is one of the most serious adverse drug reactions leading to death. The in vitro assessment of the interaction of lead compounds with HERG potassium channels, which is one of the primary known causes of VT induction, is an obligatory test during drug development. However, experimental and clinical data support the hypothesis that the inhibition of ion channels is not the only mechanism of VT induction. Therefore, the identification of other drug targets contributing to the induction of VT is crucial. We developed a systems chemical biology approach for searching for such targets. This approach involves the following steps: (1) creation of special sets of VT-causing and non-VT-causing drugs, (2) statistical analysis of in silico predicted drug-target interaction profiles of studied drugs with 1738 human protein targets for the identification of potential VT-related targets, (3) gene ontology and pathway enrichment analysis of the revealed targets for the identification of biological processes underlying drug-induced VT etiology, (4) creation of a cardiomyocyte regulatory network (CRN) based on general and heart-specific signaling and regulatory pathways, and (5) simulation of changes in the behavior of the CRN caused by the inhibition of each node for the identification of potential VT-related targets. As a result, we revealed 312 potential VT-related targets and classified them into 3 confidence categories: high (36 proteins), medium (111 proteins), and low (165 proteins) classes. The most probable targets may serve as a basis for experimental confirmation and may be used for in vitro or in silico assessments of the relationships between drug candidates and drug-induced VT, the understanding of contraindications of drug application and dangerous drug combinations.",25766883,Identification of drug targets related to the induction of ventricular tachyarrhythmia through a systems chemical biology approach.,1,1

"Congenital anomalies do not occur in all babies born after a teratogenic exposure. Whether a given exposure is teratogenic depends on the chemical nature and physical properties of the agent, the dose and route of exposure, when in pregnancy the exposure occurs, and genetic and other factors that affect susceptibility. Teratogenic birth defects are inherently multifactorial. Absolute risk, relative risk, and population attributable risk provide useful but different information regarding teratogenic effects. Statistical significance and clinical significance also are important considerations, but they may not be concordant. Demonstrating a teratogenic effect is easier if it is sought in a subgroup of patients in whom the effect is likely to be particularly prominent. The ability to detect a significant risk is, therefore, generally increased by subgroup analysis of epidemiology studies, but the greater the number of analyses performed, the higher the probability of finding associations that reach nominal statistical significance by chance alone. This problem is well recognized, but it is difficult to solve. The only compelling evidence for the reality of an association between maternal exposure to an agent during pregnancy and teratogenic effects in the children is replication of the findings in independent studies, but this is hard to obtain. As a consequence, there are very few exposures for which the available information is sufficient to make evidence-based recommendations regarding the clinical management of teratogenic risks.

"The Madín Dam is a reservoir located in the municipalities of Naucalpan and Atizapán, in the metropolitan area adjacent to Mexico City. The reservoir supplies drinking water to nearby communities and provides an area for various recreational activities, including kayaking, sailing and carp fishing. Over time, the number of specimens of common carp has notably diminished in the reservoir, which receives direct domestic drainage from two towns as well as numerous neighborhoods along the Tlalnepantla River. Diverse studies have demonstrated that the pollutants in the water of the reservoir produce oxidative stress, genotoxicity and cytotoxicity in juvenile Cyprinus carpio, possibly explaining the reduction in the population of this species; however, it is necessary to assess whether these effects may also be occurring directly in the embryos. Hence, surface water samples were taken at five sites and pharmaceutical drugs, personal care products (especially sunscreens), organophosphate and organochlorine pesticides, and other persistent organic pollutants (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons) were identified. Embryos of C. carpio were exposed to the water samples to evaluate embryolethality, modifications in embryonic development, lipoperoxidation, the quantity of hydroperoxide and oxidized proteins, and antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase, catalase and glutathione peroxidase). It was found that the polluted water of the Madín Dam gave rise to embryolethality, embryotoxicity, congenital abnormalities, and oxidative stress on the common carp embryos.",31103011,"Polluted water from an urban reservoir (Madín dam, México) induces toxicity and oxidative stress in Cyprinus carpio embryos.",1,1

"Cutaneous toxicities are the commonest side effects in patients with cancer treated using epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors such as erlotinib. For patients with such toxicities, there is a lack of safe, effective pharmacological agents. Here we established a skin toxicity model and investigated the preventive and therapeutic effect of Diallyl Trisulfide (DATS) in vivo. The mouse skin toxicities model was established through continuous administration of erlotinib for 49 days. Meanwhile, the mice in the experimental group underwent DATS treatment for 49 days. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining and oil red O staining of back and limb skin was performed to determine whether DATS aqueous extract can reverse the skin toxicities caused by erlotinib. Compared with the erlotinib group, the incidence of rash in the DATS group was lower. In addition, in the DATS group, the degree of skin redness and herpes was mild, the body weight was stable, and the activity was favorable. By comparing the HE and oil red O staining results for the mouse skin, the degree of keratin hyperplasia was determined to be lower in the experimental group than in the erlotinib group, and the number of purulent neutrophils decreased. The number of follicles was relatively less. The release of TNF-α, IL-6 and other inflammatory factors was reduced by DATS.

"The utility of fetal autopsy to corroborate antenatal ultrasound findings and to aid genetic counseling is well known. However, the ability to identify an underlying cause for the common indications for which it is performed is not well studied. This study aimed to determine if the diagnostic yield of fetal autopsy in identifying the underlying cause is determined by the indication of the autopsy. Five groups of fetuses were defined based on the indication for the autopsy performed in 903 cases: (i) malformations, (ii) intrauterine death (IUD), (iii) cystic hygroma and hydrops fetalis, (iv) isolated abnormalities of amniotic fluid, and (v) intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). The highest diagnostic yield was in fetuses with isolated abnormalities of amniotic fluid (77%), followed by those with IUGR (75%), with IUD (69.6%), those in group five (55.2%) and lowest (45%) in fetuses with malformations (P < 0.001). A cause was identified in 77.8% fetuses with multiple malformations compared to 37.5% with isolated malformations (P < 0.001), with chromosomal abnormalities in 31.8% versus 9.9% respectively (P < 0.001) and malformation syndromes in 42.5% versus 26.3% (P < 0.001). Placental examination provided the highest yield in IUD, IUGR, and oligohydramnios (43.1%; P < 0.003) whereas chromosomal analysis was most useful in cystic hygroma/NIHF (28.9%; P < 0.001).

"Cancer and its treatment are associated with neurotoxic side effects, including cognitive dysfunction, altered functional connectivity in the brain and structural abnormalities in white matter. There is evidence that cancer and its treatment can accelerate aging. Tau is a microtubule associated protein that contributes to microtubule stability thereby playing a key role in neuronal function. Clustering of tau is commonly observed in the aged brain and is related to cognitive decline. We hypothesized that chemotherapy-induced cognitive impairment is associated with accelerated development of tau clustering in the brain as a sign of accelerated aging. We show for the first time that treatment of adult (7-8 month-old) male C57BL/6 mice with cisplatin results in reduced cognitive function and a marked increase in the number of large endogenous tau clusters in the hippocampus when assessed 4 months later. In contrast, we detected only few small tau clusters in the hippocampus of age-matched 11-12 month-old control mice. Astrocyte GFAP expression was increased in close vicinity to the tau clusters in cisplatin-treated mice. We did not detect changes in the microglial marker Iba-1 in the brain of mice treated with cisplatin. The accelerated formation of Tau-1 clusters in cisplatin-treated mice was associated with a decrease in the levels of the post-synaptic marker PSD95 and of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin in the hippocampus. We demonstrate here for the first time that chemotherapy markedly accelerates development of signs of tauopathy and loss of synaptic integrity in the hippocampus. These findings provide a mechanistic link between chemotherapy cognitive decline and accelerated aging in cancer survivors.",30953771,Chemotherapy accelerates age-related development of tauopathy and results in loss of synaptic integrity and cognitive impairment.,1,1

"Since the early 1990s polymer-protein conjugates (included PEGylated enzymes and cytokines), polymeric drugs and polymeric sequestrants have been entering the market as innovative polymer-based therapeutics.

"Using rare minnow (Gobiocypris rarus) embryos as experimental model, the developmental toxicity of Cu, Zn and Cd were investigated following exposure to 0.001-1.000mg/L for 72h, and the toxicity effects were evaluated by larval malformation rate, heart rate, pericardial area, spontaneous movements, tail length, enzyme activities and biomarker genes. Our results revealed that increased malformation rate provide a gradual dose-response relationship, and the most pronounced morphological alteration was heart and body malformations. Values of 72h EC50 with their 95 percent confidence intervals on G. rarus embryos were 0.103 (0.072-0.149)mg/L for Cu, 0.531 (0.330-1.060)mg/L for Zn, 0.219 (0.147-0.351)mg/L for Cd. Enzyme activities can be regard as a type of low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition. Stress and metabolism-related genes (hsp70, cyp1a and mt) were significantly up-regulated, development-related genes (wnt8a, vezf1 and mstn) were significantly down-regulated after the treatment by Cu, Zn and Cd.

"In this article, we present a general procedure to analyze exchangeable binary data that may also be viewed as realizations of binomial mixtures. Our approach unifies existing models and is practical and computationally easy. Resulting from completely monotonic functions, we introduce a rich family of parametric parsimonious binomial mixtures, including the incomplete Beta-, Gamma-, Normal-, and Poisson-binomial, generalizing the Beta-binomial. We show that the family is closed under convex linear combinations, products, and composites. We also give the moments and the Markov property of the family. With such distributions, we can perform statistical inference on correlated binary data and, in particular, overdispersed data. We propose a regression procedure that generalizes logistic regression. We provide a forward model selection procedure. We run a small simulation to validate the inclusion of the binomial distribution.

Manipulation of co-inhibitory receptors has achieved tumor eradication in a minority of patients, but widespread immune-related adverse events (irAEs) compromised tolerance to healthy self-tissues in the majority. We have proposed that a major mechanism of irAEs is similar to a graft-versus-malignancy effect of graft-versus-host disease. To verify our hypothesis, we retrieved post-marketing data of adverse events from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System. A significant positive correlation was revealed in 7677 patients between the reporting odds ratio of irAEs during immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and the corresponding tumor mutational burden across 19 cancer types.

"Precise in vivo toxicological assays to determine the cardiotoxicity of pharmaceuticals and their waste products are essential in order to evaluate their risks to humans and the environment following industrial release. In the present study, we aimed to develop the sensitive imaging-based cardiotoxicity assay and combined 3D light-sheet microscopy with a zebrafish model to identify hidden cardiovascular anomalies induced by valproic acid (VPA) exposure. The zebrafish model is advantageous for this assessment because its embryos remain transparent. The 3D spatial localization of fluorescence-labeled cardiac cells in and around the heart using light-sheet technology revealed dislocalization of the heart from the outflow tract in two-day-old zebrafish embryos treated with 50 μM and 100 μM VPA (P < 0.01) and those embryos exposed to 20 μM VPA presented hypoplastic distal ventricles (P < 0.01). These two observed phenotypes are second heart field-derived cardiac defects. Quantitative analysis of the light-sheet imaging demonstrated that folic acid (FA) supplementation significantly increased the numbers of endocardial and myocardial cells (P < 0.05) and the accretion of second heart field-derived cardiomyocytes to the arterial pole of the outflow tract. The heart rate increased in response to the cellular changes occurring in embryonic heart development (P < 0.05).

"The sociology of emotion is rapidly evolving and has implications for medical settings. Advancing medical technologies create new contexts for decision-making and emotional reaction that are framed by ""feeling rules."" Feeling rules guide not only behavior, but also how one believes one should feel, thereby causing one to attempt to bring one's authentic feelings into line with perceived feeling rules. Using qualitative data, the theoretical existence of feeling rules in pregnancy and prenatal testing is confirmed. Further examination extends this analysis: at times of technological development feeling rules are often discrepant, leaving patients with unscripted emotion work. Data from a study of women who interrupted anomalous pregnancies indicate that feeling rules are unclear when competing feeling rules are operating during times of societal and technological change. Because much of this occurs below the level of consciousness, medical and psychological services providers need to be aware of potential discrepancies in feeling rules and assist patients in identifying the salient feeling rules.

"Objectives To identify the epidemiological risk factors for congenital anomalies (CAs) and the impact of these fetal malformations on the perinatal outcomes. Methods This prospective cohort study comprised 275 women whose fetuses had CAs. Maternal variables to establish potential risk factors for each group of CA and perinatal outcomes were evaluated. The primary outcome was CA. Secondary outcomes included: fetal growth restriction (FGR); fetal distress (FD); premature rupture of membranes (PROM); oligohydramnios or polyhydramnios; preterm delivery (PTD); stillbirth; cesarean section; low birth weight; Apgar score < 7 at the 1st and 5th minutes; need for assisted ventilation at birth; neonatal infection; need for surgical treatment; early neonatal death; and hospitalization time. Chi-square (χ(2)) test and multilevel regression analysis were applied to compare the groups and determine the effects of maternal characteristics on the incidence of CAs. Results The general prevalence of CAs was of 2.4%. Several maternal characteristics were associated to CAs, such as: age; skin color; level of education; parity; folic acid supplementation; tobacco use; and history of previous miscarriage. There were no significant differences among the CA groups in relation to FGR, FD, PROM, 1-minute Apgar score > 7, and need for assisted ventilation at birth. On the other hand, the prevalence of the other considered outcomes varied significantly among groups. Preterm delivery was significantly more frequent in gastrointestinal tract/abdominal wall defects. The stillbirth rate was increased in all CAs, mainly in isolated fetal hydrops (odds ratio [OR]: 27.13; 95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 2.90-253.47). Hospitalization time was higher for the urinary tract and congenital heart disease groups (p < 0.01). Neonatal death was significantly less frequent in the central nervous system anomalies group. Conclusion It was possible to identify several risk factors for CAs. Adverse perinatal outcomes were presented in all CA groups, and may differ according to the type of CA considered.

In intervention arm, 74 (26%) patients had at least one discrepancy on admission and 100 (35%) on discharge. Rates of preventable adverse drug events were significantly lower in intervention arm compared to standard care arm (9.1 vs. 16%, p = 0.009). No significant difference was found in healthcare resource use. Conclusion The implementation of an intervention comprising medication reconciliation and counselling by a pharmacist has significantly reduced the rate of preventable ADEs 30 days post discharge, compared to the standard care. The effect of the intervention on healthcare resource use was insignificant. Pharmacists should be included in decentralized, patient-centred roles. The findings should be interpreted in the context of the study's limitations.",29754251,"Impact of medication reconciliation and review and counselling, on adverse drug events and healthcare resource use.",0,1
"Interstitial deletion of chromosome 11 long arm is a rare event. In most of the interstitial deletions on the long arm of chromosome 11 both the position and the size of these deletions are heterogeneous making a precise karyotype-phenotype correlation.

"<b>Purpose:</b> Anti-GD2 mAbs, acting via antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, may enhance the effects of chemotherapy. This pilot trial investigated a fixed dose of a unique anti-GD2 mAb, hu14.18K322A, combined with chemotherapy, cytokines, and haploidentical natural killer (NK) cells.<b>Experimental Design:</b> Children with recurrent/refractory neuroblastoma received up to six courses of hu14.18K322A (40 mg/m<sup>2</sup>/dose, days 2-5), GM-CSF, and IL2 with chemotherapy: cyclophosphamide/topotecan (courses 1,2), irinotecan/temozolomide (courses 3,4), and ifosfamide/carboplatin/etoposide (courses 5,6). Parentally derived NK cells were administered with courses 2, 4, and 6. Serum for pharmacokinetic studies of hu14.18K322A, soluble IL2 receptor alpha (sIL2Rα) levels, and human antihuman antibodies (HAHA) were obtained.<b>Results:</b> Thirteen heavily pretreated patients (9 with prior anti-GD2 therapy) completed 65 courses. One patient developed an unacceptable toxicity (grade 4 thrombocytopenia >35 days). Four patients discontinued treatment for adverse events (hu14.18K322A allergic reaction, viral infection, surgical death, second malignancy). Common toxicities included grade 3/4 myelosuppression (13/13 patients) and grade 1/2 pain (13/13 patients). Eleven patients received 29 NK-cell infusions. The response rate was 61.5% (4 complete responses, 1 very good partial response, 3 partial responses) and five had stable disease. The median time to progression was 274 days (range, 239-568 days); 10 of 13 patients (77%) survived 1 year. Hu14.18K322A pharmacokinetics was not affected by chemotherapy or HAHA. All patients had increased sIL2Rα levels, indicating immune activation.<b>Conclusions:</b> Chemotherapy plus hu14.18K322A, cytokines, and NK cells is feasible and resulted in clinically meaningful responses in patients with refractory/recurrent neuroblastoma.

"Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is an atypical ventricular arrhythmias associated with the acquired and congenital forms of the long QT syndrome. The substrate for the arrhythmia develops as a consequence of the amplification of electrical heterogeneities intrinsic to the ventricular myocardium. These heterogeneities exist because of differences in the time course of repolarization of the three predominant cell types that make up the ventricular myocardium, giving rise to transmural voltage gradients and a dispersion of repolarization responsible for the inscription of the electrocardiographic T wave. A wide variety of drugs are capable of reducing net repolarizing current and thus amplifying the intrinsic spatial dispersion of repolarization, so as to create the substrate for the development of re-entry. The result is a prolongation of the QT interval, abnormal T waves, and development of polymorphic re-entrant ventricular tachycardia displaying characteristics of TdP. Recent studies demonstrate that prolongation of the QT interval is not the sole determinant of the potential of a drug to cause TdP; agents that do not increase transmural dispersion of repolarization have little or no potential to induce the arrhythmia despite their ability to prolong the QT interval. Moreover, drugs such as sodium pentobarbital, which reduce transmural dispersion of repolarization, can diminish the likelihood of TdP, despite their ability to prolong the QT interval.",15534788,Arrhythmogenic mechanisms of QT prolonging drugs: is QT prolongation really the problem?,1,1
"In vitro assay data have recently emerged as a potential alternative to traditional animal toxicity studies to aid in the prediction of adverse effects of chemicals on humans. Here we evaluate the data generated from a battery of quantitative high-throughput screening (qHTS) assays applied to a large and diverse collection of chemicals, including approved drugs, for their capacity in predicting human toxicity. Models were built with animal in vivo toxicity data, in vitro human cell-based assay data, as well as in combination with chemical structure and/or drug-target information to predict adverse effects observed for drugs in humans. Interestingly, we found that the models built with the human cell-based assay data performed close to those of the models based on animal in vivo toxicity data. Furthermore, expanding the biological space coverage of assays by including additional drug-target annotations was shown to significantly improve model performance. We identified a small set of targets, which, when added to the current suite of in vitro human cell-based assay data, result in models that greatly outperform those built with the existing animal toxicity data. Assays can be developed for this set of targets to screen compounds for construction of robust models for human toxicity prediction.",29491351,Expanding biological space coverage enhances the prediction of drug adverse effects in human using in vitro activity profiles.,0,1

"Birth defects are a leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, accounting for 20.6% of infant deaths in 2017 (1). Rates of infant mortality attributable to birth defects (IMBD) have generally declined since the 1970s (1-3). U.S. linked birth/infant death data from 2003-2017 were used to assess trends in IMBD. Overall, rates declined 10% during 2003-2017, but decreases varied by maternal and infant characteristics. During 2003-2017, IMBD rates decreased 4% for infants of Hispanic mothers, 11% for infants of non-Hispanic black (black) mothers, and 12% for infants of non-Hispanic white (white) mothers. In 2017, these rates were highest among infants of black mothers (13.3 per 10,000 live births) and were lowest among infants of white mothers (9.9). During 2003-2017, IMBD rates for infants who were born extremely preterm (20-27 completed gestational weeks), full term (39-40 weeks), and late term/postterm (41-44 weeks) declined 20%-29%; rates for moderate (32-33 weeks) and late preterm (34-36 weeks) infants increased 17%. Continued tracking of IMBD rates can help identify areas where efforts to reduce IMBD are needed, such as among infants born to black and Hispanic mothers and those born moderate and late preterm (32-36 weeks).",31945037,"Infant Mortality Attributable to Birth Defects - United States, 2003-2017.",0,0

"Dysregulated cell movement can lead to developmental abnormalities, neoplasia, and immune system disorders, and there are a variety of contexts in which xenobiotics (and biologic) effects on this movement are of interest. Many toxins and toxicants have been shown to disrupt controlled cell movement. Identification of compounds that affect cell movement is crucial to drug discovery. Drug components may have unexpected consequences with respect to cell motility, which would exclude these compounds in drug development. Finally, the development of drugs that target chemotactic pathways may be useful in the treatment of tumors, which often reprogram chemotactic pathways to become metastatic. The effects of these agents on cell movement can be measured using several different in vitro chemotactic assays.

"Ribavirin has been proven to be an antiviral treatment, whereas there are still risks of hemolysis and congenital malformation. Abnormal cardiac development contributes to the occurrence and development of many heart diseases. However, there is so far no evidence that ribavirin induces human cardiac developmental toxicity. Herein, we employed the cardiac differentiation model of human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) to determine the impact of ribavirin on heart development. Our data showed that ribavirin at clinically high concentrations (5 and 10 μM) significantly inhibited the proliferation and differentiation of hiPSCs from mesoderm to cardiac progenitor cells and cardiac progenitor cells to cardiomyocytes, but not from pluripotent status to mesoderm. Meanwhile, DCFH-DA staining revealed that ribavirin could increase ROS content in the mid-phase of differentiation. In addition, ribavirin treatment (1, 5 and 10 μM) remarkably caused DNA damage which was shown by the increase of γH2AX-positive cells and upregulation of the p53 during the differentiation of hiPSCs from mesoderm to cardiac progenitor cells. Moreover, exposuring to ribavirin (5 and 10 μM) markedly upregulated the expression of lncRNAs Gas5 in both mid-phase and late phase of differentiation and HBL1 in the mid-phase. In conclusion, our results suggest that ribavirin is detrimental in cardiac differentiation of hiPSCs, which may be associated with DNA damage, upregulated p53 and increased Gas5. It may provide the evidence for the rational clinical application of ribavirin.",32112805,Inhibition of cardiomyocyte differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells by Ribavirin: Implication for its cardiac developmental toxicity.,1,1

"A vital aspect of the drug discovery and development process is the identification and filtering of drugs with high risk of dangerous adverse events. Torsade de Pointes (TdP) is one example of an adverse event that requires thorough in vitro and in vivo drug screening. This is because TdP, a tachycardic ventricular arrhythmia, can develop into fatal cardiac events if left unresolved and has been missed during drug development with profound consequences. These factors led to the development of pre-clinical screening guidelines based on the presence of drug induced QT prolongation (QTp), which has been linked to TdP. These guidelines have high sensitivity, but low specificity, as they tend to predict QTp, which precedes TdP events but does not always lead to TdP. Computational models have the potential to improve these prediction methods by bridging the gaps between preclinical and clinical data. This study proposes the use of adverse event reports obtained from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System as a representation of clinical TdP risk. By incorporating these reports into computational models, a more accurate risk prediction may be developed.",31398384,Relationship of clinical adverse event reports to models of arrhythmia risk.,1,1

It is concluded that dorsal dimelia in humans is not as rare as it is generally thought to be, and that it may be viewed as an error of dorso-ventral patterning, which occurs in the same distribution as other concurrent anomalies.

"Complex interactions exist amongst the various components of the neuroendocrine system in order to maintain homeostasis, energy balance and reproductive function. These components include the hypothalamus-pituitary- adrenal and -gonadal axes, the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, the sympathetic nervous system and the pancreatic islets. These hormones, peptides and neurotransmitters act in concert to regulate the functions of many organs, notably the liver, muscles, kidneys, thyroid, bone, adrenal glands, adipocytes, vasculature, intestinal tract and gonads, through many intermediary pathways. Endocrine and metabolic disorders can arise from imbalance amongst numerous hormonal factors. These disturbances may be due to endogenous processes, such as increased secretion of hormones from a tumour, as well as exogenous drug administration. Drugs can cause endocrine abnormalities via different mechanisms, including direct alteration of hormone production, changes in the regulation of the hormonal axis, effects on hormonal transport, binding, and signalling, as well as similar changes to counter-regulatory hormone systems. Furthermore, drugs can affect the evaluation of endocrine parameters by causing interference with diagnostic tests. Common drug-induced endocrine and metabolic disorders include disorders of carbohydrate metabolism, electrolyte and calcium abnormalities, as well as drug-induced thyroid and gonadal disorders. An understanding of the proposed mechanisms of these drug effects and their evaluation and differential diagnosis may allow for more critical interpretation of the clinical observations associated with such disorders, better prediction of drug-induced adverse effects and better choices of and rationales for treatment.",17343430,Drug-induced endocrine and metabolic disorders.,1,1

"Structural birth defects in the kidney and urinary tract are observed in 0.5% of live births and are a major cause of end-stage renal disease, but their genetic aetiology is not well understood. Here we analyse 135 lines of mice identified in large-scale mouse mutagenesis screen and show that 29% of mutations causing congenital heart disease (CHD) also cause renal anomalies. The renal anomalies included duplex and multiplex kidneys, renal agenesis, hydronephrosis and cystic kidney disease. To assess the clinical relevance of these findings, we examined patients with CHD and observed a 30% co-occurrence of renal anomalies of a similar spectrum. Together, these findings demonstrate a common shared genetic aetiology for CHD and renal anomalies, indicating that CHD patients are at increased risk for complications from renal anomalies. This collection of mutant mouse models provides a resource for further studies to elucidate the developmental link between renal anomalies and CHD.

"Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is the most prevalent form of primary cardiomyopathy in humans and is a leading cause of heart failure and sudden cardiac death. Genetic abnormalities have been demonstrated to be a major contributor to the development of DCM. However, DCM is a genetically heterogeneous disease, and the genetic basis underlying DCM in a significant proportion of patients remains unclear. In the current study, the coding exons and splicing junction sites of the T‑Box 20 (TBX20) gene, which encodes a T‑box transcription factor essential for cardiac morphogenesis and structural remodeling, were sequenced in 115 unrelated patients with idiopathic DCM, and a novel heterozygous mutation, p.E143X, was identified in one patient. Genetic analysis of the mutation carrier's pedigree indicated that the nonsense mutation was present in all the living family members with DCM, and also in a female patient with a congenital atrial septal defect. The mutation, which was predicted to generate a truncated protein with only the N‑terminus and a fraction of the T‑box domain remaining, was absent in 800 control chromosomes. Functional assays using a dual‑luciferase reporter assay system revealed that the truncated TBX20 protein had no transcriptional activity in contrast to its wild‑type counterpart. Furthermore, the mutation abolished the synergistic activation between TBX20 and NK2 homeobox 5, or between TBX20 and GATA binding protein 4. The observations of the current study expand the mutation spectrum of TBX20 associated with DCM and congenital heart disease (CHD), which provide novel insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying DCM and CHD, suggesting the potential implications for the effective and personalized treatment of these diseases.

"The molecular genetic background of inherited cardiac arrhythmias has only recently been uncovered. This late development in comparison to other inherited cardiac disorders has partly been due to the high mortality and early disease onset of these arrhythmias resulting in mostly small nucleus families. Thus, traditional genetic linkage studies, which are based on the genetic information obtained from large multi-generation families, were made difficult. Inherited arrhythmogenic disorders can be divided into 'primary electrical disorders' (e.g., long-QT [LQT] syndrome) in which a detectable, organic heart disease is not evident, and into inherited diseases of the myocardial structure (e.g., hypertrophic cardiomyopathies) in which the arrhythmias occur combined with the structural alterations. To date, all inherited arrhythmogenic disorders in which the causative genes have been identified turned out to be channelopathies, since the genes encode channel subunits that regulate important ion currents that tune the cardiac action potential. The discovery of the genetic bases of the LQT syndrome became a new methodologic paradigm; because with the use of 'classical' genetic linkage strategies (named [positional] candidate strategies) not only the causative genes have been found, but moreover, functional components with a previously unknown but fundamental role for a normal repolarization process were discovered. Disease mutations turned out to be not only a family-specific event with a distinct phenotype and the potential of an additional diagnostic tool, but also, when expressed in heterologous expression systems, characterize the defective ion channel in a topological way and lead to a more specific understanding of ion channel function. Most, if not all, primary electrical cardiac disorders show a high genetic diversity. For the LQT syndromes, sixth disease loci and the responsible gene have been recently discovered (so-called locus or genetic heterogeneity). Within all disease genes, the mutations are spread over the entire gene (allelic heterogeneity); in addition, more than one disease mutation may be present. This complexity requires, at least, complete mutation analysis of all LQT genes before medical advice should be given. Meanwhile, genotype-phenotype correlations in large families are being used to evaluate intergene, interfamilial and intrafamilial differences in the clinical phenotype, reflecting gene specific, gene-site specific and individual consequences of a given mutation. A widespread phenotypic heterogeneity even within mutation carriers in the same family raises the importance of modifying factors and genes that are mostly unknown to date. The reduced penetrance and variable expressivity associated with the LQT mutations remain still to be explained. First insights into the complex actions of mutations are being extracted, from expression data; these preliminary results may lead to potential implications for a specific (gene-site directed) therapy. This paper discusses the current data on molecular genetics and genotype-phenotype correlations in LQT syndrome and related disorders and the potential implications for diagnosis and treatment.",10810773,Molecular genetics of arrhythmias--a new paradigm.,1,1

"<b>Background:</b> The diagnosis of long QT syndrome (LQTS) is rather straightforward. We were surprised by realizing that, despite long-standing experience, we were making occasional diagnostic errors by considering as affected subjects that, over time, resulted as not affected. These individuals were all actively practicing sports, an observation which helped to design our study. <b>Methods:</b> We focused on subjects referred to our Center by Sports Medicine doctors with a suspicion of LQTS because of marked repolarization abnormalities on the ECG performed during the mandatory medical visit necessary in Italy to obtain the certificate of eligibility to practice sports. They all underwent our standard procedures involving both a resting and 12-lead ambulatory ECG, an exercise stress test, and genetic screening. <b>Results:</b> There were 310 such consecutive subjects, all actively practicing sports with many hours of intensive weekly training. Of them, 111 had a normal ECG, different cardiac diseases or were lost to follow-up and exited the study. Of the remaining 199, all with either clear QTc prolongation and/or typical repolarization abnormalities, 121 were diagnosed as affected based on combination of ECG abnormalities with positive genotyping (QTc 482±35 ms). Genetic testing was negative in 78 subjects but 45 were nonetheless diagnosed as affected by LQTS based on unequivocal ECG abnormalities (QTc 472±33 ms). The remaining 33, entirely asymptomatic and with a negative family history, following detraining showed an unexpected and practically complete normalization of the ECG abnormalities (their QTc shortened from 492±37 to 423±25 ms, p<0.001, and their Schwartz score went from 3.0 to 0.06). They were considered not affected by congenital LQTS and are henceforth referred to as ""Cases"". Furthermore, among them, those who resume a similarly heavy physical training showed reappearance of the repolarization abnormalities. <b>Conclusions:</b> It is not uncommon to suspect LQTS among individuals actively practicing sports, based on marked repolarization abnormalities. Among those who are genotype-negative, >40% normalize their ECG following detraining but the abnormalities tend to recur with resumption of training. These individuals are not affected by LQTS but could have a form of acquired LQTS.

"The traditional classification of congenital aortic arch abnormalities was described by James Stewart and colleagues in 1964. Since that time, advances in diagnostic imaging technology have led to better delineation of the vasculature anatomy and the identification of previously unrecognized and unclassified anomalies. In this manuscript, we review the existing literature and propose a series of modifications to the original Stewart classification of congenital aortic arch abnormalities to incorporate this new knowledge. In brief, we propose the following modifications: (1) In Group I, we further divide subgroup B into left arch atretic and right arch atretic; (2) In Group II, we add three more subgroups, including aberrant right innominate artery, ""isolated"" right innominate artery (RIA), ""isolated"" right carotid artery with aberrant right subclavian artery; (3) In Groups I, II, and III, we add a subgroup of absence of both ductus arteriosus; and (4) In Group IV, we add three subgroups, including circumflex retro-esophageal aorta arch, persistent V aortic arch, and anomalous origin of pulmonary artery from ascending aorta.",30623879,Congenital abnormalities of the aortic arch: revisiting the 1964 Stewart classification.,1,0

"Adverse drug reactions have been linked with genetic polymorphisms in HLA genes in numerous different studies. HLA proteins have an essential role in the presentation of self and non-self peptides, as part of the adaptive immune response. Amongst the associated drugs-allele combinations, anti-HIV drug Abacavir has been shown to be associated with the HLA-B*57:01 allele, and anti-epilepsy drug Carbamazepine with B*15:02, in both cases likely following the altered peptide repertoire model of interaction. Under this model, the drug binds directly to the antigen presentation region, causing different self peptides to be presented, which trigger an unwanted immune response. There is growing interest in searching for evidence supporting this model for other ADRs using bioinformatics techniques. In this study, in silico docking was used to assess the utility and reliability of well-known docking programs when addressing these challenging HLA-drug situations. The overall aim was to address the uncertainty of docking programs giving different results by completing a detailed comparative study of docking software, grounded in the MHC-ligand experimental structural data - for Abacavir and to a lesser extent Carbamazepine - in order to assess their performance. Four docking programs: SwissDock, ROSIE, AutoDock Vina and AutoDockFR, were used to investigate if each software could accurately dock the Abacavir back into the crystal structure for the protein arising from the known risk allele, and if they were able to distinguish between the HLA-associated and non-HLA-associated (control) alleles. The impact of using homology models on the docking performance and how using different parameters, such as including receptor flexibility, affected the docking performance were also investigated to simulate the approach where a crystal structure for a given HLA allele may be unavailable. The programs that were best able to predict the binding position of Abacavir were then used to recreate the docking seen for Carbamazepine with B*15:02 and controls alleles. It was found that the programs investigated were sometimes able to correctly predict the binding mode of Abacavir with B*57:01 but not always. Each of the software packages that were assessed could predict the binding of Abacavir and Carbamazepine within the correct sub-pocket and, with the exception of ROSIE, was able to correctly distinguish between risk and control alleles. We found that docking to homology models could produce poorer quality predictions, especially when sequence differences impact the architecture of predicted binding pockets. Caution must therefore be used as inaccurate structures may lead to erroneous docking predictions. Incorporating receptor flexibility was found to negatively affect the docking performance for the examples investigated. Taken together, our findings help characterise the potential but also the limitations of computational prediction of drug-HLA interactions. These docking techniques should therefore always be used with care and alongside other methods of investigation, in order to be able to draw strong conclusions from the given results.",30125869,Critical assessment of approaches for molecular docking to elucidate associations of HLA alleles with adverse drug reactions.,0,1

"Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) is a severe birth defect that is often accompanied by other congenital anomalies. Previous exome sequencing studies for CDH have supported a role of de novo damaging variants but did not identify any recurrently mutated genes. To investigate further the genetics of CDH, we analyzed de novo coding variants in 362 proband-parent trios including 271 new trios reported in this study. We identified four unrelated individuals with damaging de novo variants in MYRF (P = 5.3x10(-8)), including one likely gene-disrupting (LGD) and three deleterious missense (D-mis) variants. Eight additional individuals with de novo LGD or missense variants were identified from our other genetic studies or from the literature. Common phenotypes of MYRF de novo variant carriers include CDH, congenital heart disease and genitourinary abnormalities, suggesting that it represents a novel syndrome. MYRF is a membrane associated transcriptional factor highly expressed in developing diaphragm and is depleted of LGD variants in the general population. All de novo missense variants aggregated in two functional protein domains. Analyzing the transcriptome of patient-derived diaphragm fibroblast cells suggest that disease associated variants abolish the transcription factor activity. Furthermore, we showed that the remaining genes with damaging variants in CDH significantly overlap with genes implicated in other developmental disorders. Gene expression patterns and patient phenotypes support pleiotropic effects of damaging variants in these genes on CDH and other developmental disorders. Finally, functional enrichment analysis implicates the disruption of regulation of gene expression, kinase activities, intra-cellular signaling, and cytoskeleton organization as pathogenic mechanisms in CDH.",30532227,De novo variants in congenital diaphragmatic hernia identify MYRF as a new syndrome and reveal genetic overlaps with other developmental disorders.,1,0

"The International Conference on Harmonisation E14 Guidance was successful in largely standardizing the conduct of the so-called thorough QT/QTc studies (TQTS). Nevertheless, there is still a spectrum of frequently encountered problems with details of design, conduct and interpretation of TQTS. Several of these challenges are reviewed here, starting with explaining that the TQTS goal is only to identify drugs for which the proarrhythmic risk might be considered excluded for the purposes of regulatory benefit-risk assessment. Suggestions are made on how to categorize and quantify or exclude proarrhythmic risk if the TQTS is positive. There is a conceptual need for TQTS, and this is discussed, together with reasons why restricted clinical registries cannot prove the absence of proarrhythmic liability of any drug. Appropriate drug doses investigated in TQTS should be derived from the maximum clinically tolerable dose rather than from the known or expected therapeutic dose. With the help of concentration-QTc modelling, the standard therapeutic dose can be omitted from TQTS, especially if the study is expected to be negative. Conditions for single-dose TQTS acceptability are reviewed. The role of the so-called positive control is assessed, contrasting the role of a same-class comparator for the investigated drug. A single 400 mg dose of moxifloxacin is advocated as the present 'gold standard' assay sensitivity test. The necessity of careful placebo control is explained and the frequency of ECG assessments is considered. The central tendency and outlier analyses are discussed, together with the correct approaches to baseline adjustment. The review concludes that the design and interpretation of TQTS must not be approached with mechanistic stereotypes, and highlights the importance of relating the QTc changes to drug plasma levels.",20000862,Thorough QT Studies: Questions and Quandaries.,1,1

"Psychiatric comorbidities are common in people with epilepsy. A retrospective study of characteristics associated with withdrawal due to psychiatric side effects was undertaken in patients with treated epilepsy participating in prospective audits with new antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). A total of 1058 treated patients with uncontrolled seizures (942 focal-onset seizures, 116 generalized genetic epilepsies [GGEs]) participated in eight prospective, observational audits from 1996 to 2014. These patients were prescribed adjunctive topiramate (n=170), levetiracetam (n=220), pregabalin (n=135), zonisamide (n=203), lacosamide (n=160), eslicarbazepine acetate (n=52), retigabine (n=64), or perampanel (n=54). Doses were titrated according to efficacy and tolerability to optimize zeizure outcomes and reduce side effects. Psychiatric comorbidities were recorded prior to and after the addition of each AED. At baseline, patients with focal-onset seizures (189 of 942; 20.1%) were statistically more likely to have psychiatric diagnoses compared to patients with GGEs (14 of 116, 12.1%; p=0.039). Following adjunctive AED treatment, neuropsychiatric adverse effects led to AED withdrawal in 1.9-16.7% of patients. Patients with a pre-treatment psychiatric history (22 of 209; 10.5%) were statistically more likely to discontinue their new AED due to psychiatric issues compared to patients with no previous psychiatric diagnosis (50 of 849; 5.9%; p=0.017). Patients receiving sodium channel blocking AEDs (4 of 212, 1.9%) were statistically less likely to develop intolerable psychiatric problems, compared to those on AEDs possessing other mechanisms of action (68 of 846, 8.0%; p=0.012). Depression was the commonest problem, leading to discontinuation of AEDs in 2.8% (n=30) patients.

"Sodium aescinate (SA) is a widely-applied triterpene saponin product derived from horse chestnut seeds, possessing vasoactive and organ-protective activities with oral or injection administration in the clinic. To date, no toxicity or adverse events in SA have been reported, by using routine models (in vivo or in vitro), which are insufficient to predict all aspects of its pharmacological and toxicological actions. In this study, taking advantage of transparent zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio), we evaluated cardiovascular toxicity of SA at doses of 1/10 MNLC, 1/3 MNLC, MNLC and LC10 by yolk sac microinjection. The qualitative and quantitative cardiotoxicity in zebrafish was assessed at 48 h post-SA treatment, using specific phenotypic endpoints: heart rate, heart rhythm, heart malformation, pericardial edema, circulation abnormalities, thrombosis and hemorrhage. The results showed that SA at 1/10 MNLC and above doses could induce obvious cardiac and pericardial malformations, whilst 1/3 MNLC and above doses could induce significant cardiac malfunctions (heart rate and circulation decrease/absence), as compared to untreated or vehicle-treated control groups. Such cardiotoxic manifestations occurred in more than 50% to 100% of all zebrafish treated with SA at MNLC and LC10. Our findings have uncovered the potential cardiotoxicity of SA for the first time, suggesting more attention to the risk of its clinical application. Such a time- and cost-saving zebrafish cardiotoxicity assay is very valid and reliable for rapid prediction of compound toxicity during drug research and development.

In the limb reduction study, the study mothers were prescribed more drugs generally although this did not reach statistical significance, nor were there significant differences between study and control mothers for individual groups of drugs. In the oral cleft study, significantly more drugs were prescribed to study mothers in the three months before the last menstrual period, and a similar trend, which did not reach statistical significance, was observed in the first trimester. Anticonvulsant drugs were prescribed significantly more frequently to study mothers during the whole period of the study. A significant association was also demonstrated between oral contraceptives taken in the three months before the last menstrual period and oral cleft, but doubt must remain concerning this relationship; the risk is not well understood and is likely to be nonspecific.

"Immune-checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), including anti-cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies, are arguably the most important development in cancer therapy over the past decade. The indications for these agents continue to expand across malignancies and disease settings, thus reshaping many of the previous standard-of-care approaches and bringing new hope to patients. One of the costs of these advances is the emergence of a new spectrum of immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which are often distinctly different from the classical chemotherapy-related toxicities. Owing to the growing use of ICIs in oncology, clinicians will increasingly be confronted with common but also rare irAEs; hence, awareness needs to be raised regarding the clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of these toxicities. In this Review, we provide an overview of the various types of irAEs that have emerged to date. We discuss the epidemiology of these events and their kinetics, risk factors, subtypes and pathophysiology, as well as new insights regarding screening and surveillance strategies. We also highlight the most important aspects of the management of irAEs.",31092901,"Adverse effects of immune-checkpoint inhibitors: epidemiology, management and surveillance.",0,1

"The introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors into clinical practice now offers most patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia lengthy remissions and the possibility of normal life expectancies. These improved survivals have resulted in the need to address issues relating to quality of life, including fertility and procreation. Treatment may require lifelong daily therapy with drugs that might inhibit proteins essential to gonadal function, implantation, and embryogenesis. Animal data suggest that imatinib at standard dosages is unlikely to impair fertility in either adult male or female animals. However, human data remain limited, particularly in children and adolescents. Children born to men who are actively taking imatinib at conception seem healthy, and current advice is not to discontinue treatment. In contrast, data are less encouraging for children born to women exposed to imatinib during pregnancy. Although numbers are small, a disturbing cluster of rare congenital malformations has prevented imatinib from being recommended safely, particularly during the period of organogenesis. Alternative strategies for managing pregnancy in chronic myelogenous leukemia include one or both of regular leukapheresis and interferon-alpha.

"One of the critical stages in drug development is the identification of potential side effects for promising drug leads. Large-scale clinical experiments aimed at discovering such side effects are very costly and may miss subtle or rare side effects. Previous attempts to systematically predict side effects are sparse and consider each side effect independently. In this work, we report on a novel approach to predict the side effects of a given drug, taking into consideration information on other drugs and their side effects. Starting from a query drug, a combination of canonical correlation analysis and network-based diffusion is applied to predict its side effects. We evaluate our method by measuring its performance in a cross validation setting using a comprehensive data set of 692 drugs and their known side effects derived from package inserts. For 34% of the drugs, the top scoring side effect matches a known side effect of the drug. Remarkably, even on unseen data, our method is able to infer side effects that highly match existing knowledge. In addition, we show that our method outperforms a prediction scheme that considers each side effect separately. Our method thus represents a promising step toward shortcutting the process and reducing the cost of side effect elucidation.",21385029,An algorithmic framework for predicting side effects of drugs.,0,0
"Safety pharmacologists from the Japanese pharmaceutical industries and contract laboratories made a database to evaluate drug effects on the QT interval in 2005. This QT PRODACT project was a prospective study of 12 QT-prolonging (positive) drugs and 10 non-prolonging (negative) drugs to evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of several in vivo and in vitro animal models: in vitro guinea pig papillary muscle action potential recordings and in vivo ECG recordings in unanesthetized or anesthetized beagle dogs, cynomolgus monkeys and miniature pigs. In guinea pig papillary muscle action potential recordings, positive drugs showed lengthening of the action potential duration (APD). By using a new measure to detect triangulation of the action potential configuration, an IKr blocking activity of drugs with Ca channel blocking action was detected. All in vivo studies showed a QT-prolonging effect of greater than 10% for the positive drugs. These in vivo models were useful to distinguish positive from negative drugs. The QT PRODACT project showed reliability and sensitivity of the experiments to detect positive drugs. The proarrhythmic effects of these positive drugs could not be detected even though, in some animal models (e.g., unanesthetized monkey), torsades de pointes (TdP)-type arrhythmias were shown by terfenadine. We compared in vivo arrhythmia models for proarrhythmia.

"Fluoropyrimidines (FLs) have been widely used for more than 60 years against a range of solid tumors and still remains the cornerstone for the treatment of colorectal, gastric, and breast cancer. Here, we performed an economic analysis to estimate the cost of DPYD-guided toxicity management and the clinical benefit expressed as quality adjusted life years (QALYs) in a large group of 571 individuals of Italian origin suffering from cancer and treated with a fluoropyrimidines-based chemotherapy. Individuals suffering from cancer with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of cancer, who received a fluoropyrimidines-based treatment, were retrospectively genotyped in the DPYD gene. Effectiveness was measured as survival of individuals from chemotherapy, while study data on safety and efficacy as well as on resource utilization associated with each adverse drug reaction were used to measure costs to treat these adverse drug reactions. A generalized linear regression model was used to estimate cost differences for both study groups. DPYD extensive metabolizers (528 individuals) had greater effectiveness and lesser cost, representing a cost-saving option over DPYD intermediate and poor metabolizers (43 individuals) with mean QALYs of 4.18 (95%CI: 3.16-5.55) versus 3.02 (95%CI: 1.94-4.25), respectively. Our economic analysis showed that there are some indications for differences in survival between the two groups (p > 0.05), while the cost of DPYD extensive metabolizers was significantly lower (p < 0.01) compared with those belonging to the group of intermediate/poor metabolizers.

                        <i>Introduction:</i>
                    </b> Major colorectal surgery procedures are complex operations that can result in significant postoperative pain and complications. More evidence is needed to demonstrate how opioid-related adverse drug events (ORADEs) after colorectal surgery can affect hospital length of stay (LOS), hospital revenue, and what their association is with clinical conditions. By understanding the clinical and economic impact of potential ORADEs within colorectal surgery, we hope to further guide approaches to perioperative pain management in an effort to improve patient care and reduce hospital costs. <b>
                        <i>Materials and Methods:</i>
                    </b> We conducted a retrospective study utilizing the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Administrative Database to analyze Medicare discharges involving three colorectal surgery diagnosis-related groups (DRGs) to identify potential ORADEs. The impact of potential ORADEs on mean hospital LOS and hospital revenue was analyzed. <b>
                        <i>Results:</i>
                    </b> The potential ORADE rate in patients undergoing colorectal surgery was 23.92%. The mean LOS for discharges with a potential ORADE was 5.35 days longer than without an ORADE. The mean hospital revenue per day with a potential ORADE was $418 less than without an ORADE. Any type of open surgery had a statistically significant higher potential ORADE rate than the matched laparoscopic case (<i>P</i> < .001). Clinical conditions most strongly associated with ORADEs in colorectal surgery included septicemia, pneumonia, shock, and fluid and electrolyte disorders. <b>
                        <i>Conclusion:</i>
                    </b> The incidence of ORADEs in colorectal surgery is high and is associated with longer hospital stays and reduced hospital revenue. Reducing the use of opioids in the perioperative setting, such as using multimodal analgesia strategies, may lead to positive outcomes with shorter hospital stays, increased hospital revenue, and improved patient care.",31556797,The Association Between Potential Opioid-Related Adverse Drug Events and Outcomes in Colorectal Surgery.,0,0

"Owing to its association with Torsades de Pointes, drug-induced QT interval prolongation has been and remains a significant hurdle to the development of safe, effective medicines. Genetic and pharmacological evidence highlighting the pivotal role the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) channel was a critical step in understanding how to start addressing this issue. It led to the development of hERG assays with the rapid throughput needed for the short timescales required in early drug discovery. The resulting volume of hERG data has fostered in silico models to help chemists design compounds with reduced hERG potency. In early drug discovery, a pragmatic approach based on exceeding a given potency value has been required to decide when a compound is likely to carry a low QT risk, to support its progression to late-stage discovery. At this point, the in vivo efficacy and metabolism characteristics of the potential drug are generally defined, as well its safety profile, which includes usually a dog study to assess QT interval prolongation risk. The hERG and in vivo QT data, combined with the likely indication and the estimated free drug level for efficacy, are put together to assess the risk that the potential drug will prolong QT in man. Further data may be required to refine the risk assessment before making the major investment decisions for full development. The non-clinical data are essential to inform decisions about compound progression and to optimize the design of clinical QT studies.",20141516,An introduction to QT interval prolongation and non-clinical approaches to assessing and reducing risk.,1,1

Twenty children aged 3 days to 6 years, admitted to the cardiovascular intensive care unit after congenital heart surgery, received an intravenous (IV) loading dose of morphine (0.15 mg/kg) followed by subsequent intermittent IV bolus doses based on a validated pain scale. Plasma samples were collected over 6 h after the loading dose and randomly after follow-up doses to measure morphine and its major metabolite concentrations. A population pharmacokinetic model was developed with the non-linear mixed effects software NONMEM. Parent disposition was adequately described by a linear two-compartment model. Effect of growth (size and maturation) on morphine parameters was accounted for by allometric body weight-based models. An intermediate compartment with Emax model best characterized glucuronide concentrations. Glomerular filtration rate was identified as a significant predictor of glucuronide formation time delay and maximum concentrations. Clearance of morphine in children with congenital heart disease is comparable to that reported in children without cardiac abnormalities of similar age. Children 1-6 months of age need higher morphine doses per kilogram to achieve an area under concentration-time curve comparable to that in older children.

Specifically, we will look at the evidence for using ILE in LAST as well as toxicity due to beta-blockers, calcium-channel blockers, and tricyclic antidepressants. We will also review the current dosing recommendations as well as potential side effects of ILE as an antidote. ",22733724,Intravenous lipid emulsion for the treatment of drug toxicity.,0,0

"Drug toxicity presents a major challenge in drug development and patient care. We set to build upon previous works regarding select drug-induced toxicities to find common patterns in the mode of action of the drugs associated with these toxicities. In particular, we focused on five disparate organ toxicities, peripheral neuropathy (PN), rhabdomyolysis (RM), Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrosis (SJS/TEN), lung injury (LI), and heart contraction-related cardiotoxicity (CT), and identified biological commonalities between and among the toxicities in terms of pharmacological targets and nearest neighbors (indirect effects) using the hyper-geometric test and a distance metric of Spearman correlation. There were 20 significant protein targets associated with two toxicities and 0 protein targets associated with three or more toxicities. Per Spearman distance, PN was closest to SJS/TEN compared to other pairs, whereas the pairs involving RM were more different than others excluding RM. The significant targets associated with RM outnumbered those associated with every one of the other four toxicities. Enrichment analysis of drug targets that are expressed in corresponding organ/tissues determined proteins that should be avoided in drug discovery. The identified biological patterns emerging from the mode of action of these drugs are statistically associated with these serious toxicities and could potentially be used as predictors for new drug candidates. The predictive power and usefulness of these biological patterns will increase with the database of these five toxicities. Furthermore, extension of our approach to all severe adverse reactions will produce useful biological commonalities for reference in drug discovery and development.",27063352,Computed Biological Relations among Five Select Treatment-Related Organ/Tissue Toxicities.,0,0
"Identifying unexpected drug-protein interactions is crucial for drug repurposing. We develop a comprehensive proteome scale approach that predicts human protein targets and side effects of drugs. For drug-protein interaction prediction, FINDSITE(comb), whose average precision is ~30% and recall ~27%, is employed. For side effect prediction, a new method is developed with a precision of ~57% and a recall of ~24%. Our predictions show that drugs are quite promiscuous, with the average (median) number of human targets per drug of 329 (38), while a given protein interacts with 57 drugs. The result implies that drug side effects are inevitable and existing drugs may be useful for repurposing, with only ~1,000 human proteins likely causing serious side effects. A killing index derived from serious side effects has a strong correlation with FDA approved drugs being withdrawn. Therefore, it provides a pre-filter for new drug development. The methodology is free to the academic community on the DR. PRODIS (DRugome, PROteome, and DISeasome) webserver at http://cssb.biology.gatech.edu/dr.prodis/. DR. PRODIS provides protein targets of drugs, drugs for a given protein target, associated diseases and side effects of drugs, as well as an interface for the virtual target screening of new compounds.

"To understand the characteristics of adverse reactions and find early warning signs after intake of Guizhi Fuling Capsules. The 1 500 adverse reaction(ADR) cases of Guizhi Fuling Capsules obtained by spontaneous reporting system(SRS) from 2008 to 2017 were analyzed by proportional reporting ratios method(PRR), Bayesian confidence propagation neural network method(BCPNN) and propensity score method. The number of ADR reports increased year by year, and reached the peak in the fourth quarter of 2014. A total of 1 500 ADR cases were monitored, including 10 severe ADR cases. There were a total of 934 cases aged between 18-44 years old, accounting for 62.27%. All patients were orally administered. Among them, 1 398 patients received a single dose according to the package insert, and 57.4% had ADR within 24 h. The top five clinical manifestations of ADR were gastric dysfunction, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting and rash, which mainly damaged the digestive system. The ADR signals were analyzed. PRR suggested that ""gastric dysfunction"" and ""abdominal pain"" were the early warning signals of Guizhi Fuling Capsules. BCPNN suggested that ""nausea"" and ""abdominal pain"" were the early warning signals of Guizhi Fuling Capsules. After the propensity score weighting method was used to control the confounding factors, the warning signals remained unchanged.

"A clinical association between a specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele and idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions (IADRs) is a strong indication that IADRs are mediated by the adaptive immune system. For example, it is well-established that HLA-B*15:02 and HLA-B*57:01 are associated with carbamazepine-induced Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and abacavir-induced hypersensitivity/flucloxacillin-induced liver injury, respectively. Drug-specific T-cells whose response is restricted by specific HLA risk alleles have been detected from IADR patients, also suggesting an adaptive immune pathogenesis. T-cells from carbamazepine SJS/TEN patients are activated by direct pharmacological interaction between carbamazepine and HLA-B*15:02 expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs). Abacavir-specific, HLA-B*57:01-restricted T-cells are activated by APCs presenting peptides which are only displayed by the HLA molecule when abacavir is bound during peptide loading. Finally, HLA-B*57:01-restricted activation of T-cells from patients with flucloxacillin-induced liver injury is dependent on processing of drug protein adducts. Based on these observations, it is now possible to utilize blood from healthy drug-naïve volunteers to study the priming of naïve T-cells to drugs. Future development of these methodologies may lead to the development of assays that predict intrinsic immunogenicity of drugs and chemicals at the preclinical stage of drug development.",28017537,Human leukocyte antigen and idiosyncratic adverse drug reactions.,0,1

"Limb congenital defects afflict approximately 0.6:1000 live births. In addition to genetic factors, prenatal exposure to drugs and environmental toxicants, represents a major contributing factor to limb defects. Examples of well-recognized limb teratogenic agents include thalidomide, warfarin, valproic acid, misoprostol, and phenytoin. While the mechanism by which these agents cause dymorphogenesis is increasingly clear, prediction of the limb teratogenicity of many thousands of as yet uncharacterized environmental factors (pollutants) remains inexact. This is limited by the insufficiencies of currently available models. Specifically, in vivo approaches using guideline animal models have inherently deficient predictive power due to genomic and anatomic differences that complicate mechanistic comparisons. On the other hand, in vitro two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, while accessible for cellular and molecular experimentation, do not reflect the three-dimensional (3D) morphogenetic events in vivo nor systemic influences. More robust and accessible models based on human cells that accurately replicate specific processes of embryonic limb development are needed to enhance limb teratogenesis prediction and to permit mechanistic analysis of the adverse outcome pathways. Recent advances in elucidating mechanisms of normal development will aid in the development of process-specific 3D cell cultures within specialized bioreactors to support multicellular microtissues or organoid constructs that will lead to increased understanding of cell functions, cell-to-cell signaling, pathway networks, and mechanisms of toxicity. The promise is prompting researchers to look to such 3D microphysiological systems to help sort out complex and often subtle interactions relevant to developmental malformations that would not be evident by standard 2D cell culture testing.

Using the anthelmintic drug albendazole as a model substance, we demonstrated stage-dependent toxic effects at three windows of zebrafish embryo development, i.e. 2-3, 12-14 and 24-28h post fertilization, and showed that MAS, by metabolic deactivation, reduced the toxicity of albendazole at all time points. Chemical analysis confirmed that albendazole was efficiently metabolized by MAS to the corresponding sulfoxide and sulfone, which are non-toxic to zebrafish embryos.

"To analyze the impact of commonly used drugs on male fertility, we assessed the clinical characteristics of patients with impaired semen quality while they were taking medication for chronic diseases and after switching therapies. Of 1768 infertile males, 201 patients were taking medications and had impaired semen quality without any seminal tract obstruction, spermatogenic abnormalities or hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. Of these 201 men, a total of 165 had no history of testicular diseases nor abnormalities in any examinations. Amongst them, H1 receptor antagonists were the most common medication taken, followed by antiepileptics and antibiotics. They were divided into two groups: an intervention group (73 patients), who could stop or switch their medications, and a control group (92 patients), who could not. In the intervention group, semen quality improvement rate and conception rate (93% and 85%, respectively) were much higher than those of the control group (12% and 10%, respectively). After switching therapies, the time interval before conception was 7.3 months, which was significantly shorter in asthenozoospermia than oligozoospermia. Our results confirm the potential fertility hazards of commonly used drugs and their reversibility.

"Sudden death among athletes is very rare (1:50,000-1:100,000 annually) but it is still 2-4 times more frequent than in the age-matched control population and attracts significant media attention. We propose a mechanism underlying sudden cardiac death in athletes that does not relate to myocardial ischemia but is based on repolarization abnormalities due to potassium channel downregulation and can also be best explained by the concurrent presence of several factors such as cardiac hypertrophy (athlete's heart), and/or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, increased sympathetic tone, genetic defects, drugs, doping agents, food, or dietary ingredients. These factors together can increase the repolarization inhomogeneity of the heart (""substrate"") and an otherwise harmless extrasystole (""trigger"") occurring with a very unfortunate timing may sometimes induce life-threatening arrhythmias. The effective and possible prevention of sudden cardiac death requires the development of novel cost effective cardiac electrophysiological screening methods.

Methods This was a cross-sectional study with older inpatients in the internal medicine ward of a teaching hospital. The dependent variable was the occurrence of an ADR during hospitalization. The independent variables were gender, age, length of hospitalization, number of health problems, medications, and potentially inappropriate medications for the older. Logistic regression was performed to analyze the association between an ADR and the independent variables. Main outcome measure Factors associated with ADR in older inpatients. Results Among the 237 inpatients investigated, 50 (21.1%) developed at least one ADR.

"The most commonly occurring cardiotoxic reactions in humans are due to over-exposure to chemicals that affect physiological function of the heart. These effects, which are usually receptor-mediated, are dose related and can generally be predicted from safety studies in animals. Direct chemical toxicity is initiated by an interaction of a reactive metabolite of the xenobiotic with cellular macromolecules. The incidence of such cardiotoxicity is low because few of these chemicals are metabolized in the heart. The concentration of cellular protective substances influences the development of such toxicity, and therefore species variation should be considered in safety studies.

"The present article aimed to evaluate the impact of congenital Müllerian anomalies (MA) on twin pregnancy after 24 gestational weeks in Korean women. All records of twin pregnancies in a large maternity hospital in Korea between January 2005 and July 2013 were analyzed. Patients with monochorionic monoamniotic (MCMA) twins, non-Korean patients, patients with twins delivered prior to 24 gestational weeks, and patients with miscarriage of one fetus or intrauterine fetal death (IUFD) before 24 gestational weeks were excluded from data analysis. In total, 1,422 women with twin pregnancy were eligible for data analysis, including 17 (1.2%) who had a known congenital MA (septate uterus, bicornuate uterus, arcuate uterus, and unicornuate uterus). Except for the mode of conception, baseline demographics were similar between women with MA and those without MA. No significant differences were found in pregnancy outcomes of gestational age at delivery (p = .86), birth weight of smaller and larger twins (p = .54 and p = .65), and number of twins with birth weight <5th percentile for gestational age (p = .43).The rates of obstetrical complications such as pre-eclampsia, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), placenta previa, cerclage, IUFD, and postpartum hemorrhage were not significantly different between the two groups either. We concluded that the presence of congenital MA may not increase obstetrical risks in outcomes of pregnancy of twins delivered after 24 gestational weeks.",26880019,Evidence for No Significant Impact of Müllerian Anomalies on Reproductive Outcomes of Twin Pregnancy in Korean Women.,0,0
"Background Adverse Drug Reaction is any unintended drug consequence. It is often preventable. In developed countries, it is among the top ten leading causes of morbidity and mortality. However, it's monitoring is largely unexplored in developing countries like Nepal. Objective To identify and characterize the pattern of Adverse Drug Reactions at BP Koirala Instittue of Health Science (BPKIHS), the Eastern Regional Pharmacovigilance Centre of Nepal. Method It was an observational study among the patients presented to different Clinical Departments of BPKIHS. Study duration was between July 2012 to July 2015. Adverse Drug Reactions were documented in a structured questionnaire and analysis done, in the department of Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics, using Microsoft 2013 Excel. Result There were total 150 Adverse Drug Reactions documented mostly in the age range of 19-40 years (61.4%) with female preponderance (56.7%). Maximum Adverse Drug Reactions were collected from Psychiatry (60.7%) followed by Dental surgery (17.3%) and Internal Medicine (10.7%). Most frequent Adverse Drug Reactions were seen with drugs primarily affecting CNS (64.7%), followed by steroids (18.0%) and Antimicrobial drugs (12.0%). Among CNS drugs, Antidepressants (93.6%) accounted for most documentation. Weight gain (20.1%), Fatigue (12.4%), Rash (8.1%), Acid peptic disorder (7.7%), Headache (7.2%) and Puffiness of face (7.2%) were the most frequently encountered Adverse Drug Reactions.

"Caveolin-1 (Cav-1) exerts major regulatory functions on intracellular signaling pathways originating at the plasma membrane. Cav-1 is a key regulator in adverse lung remodeling and the development of pulmonary hypertension (PH) regulating vasomotor tone through its ability to reduce nitric oxide (NO) production. This low-output endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) derived NO maintains normal pulmonary vascular homeostasis. Cav-1 deficiency leads to increased bioavailability of NO, which has been linked to increased nitrosative stress. Inhibition of eNOS reduced oxidant production and reversed PH, supporting the concept that Cav-1 regulation of eNOS activity is crucial to endothelial homeostasis in lungs.

"Teratology is the study of anatomical and physiological abnormalities, commonly known as birth defects. If an embryo is exposed to a harmful substance, or teratogen, during the critical period of development, an ensuing malformation may occur. These malformations and their associated mechanisms are studied and analyzed in laboratory animals in order to prevent them from occurring in humans. Rodents such as rats and mice have commonly been used in such studies because of their similarity to humans. In 1959, James G. Wilson designed, developed, and tested a protocol on how to observe and analyze structural malformations in rodent fetuses, which included: external examination, skeletal evaluation, soft tissue analysis, and data collection/analysis. For standardization purposes, i.e., to normalize findings from one lab to another, it is important that this protocol be followed with precision. Although many years have passed since Wilson initially created this protocol, it is still widely used to this day, and only minor changes have been made to his instructions such as the chemical reagents used in the experiments and methods of analysis of the experimental data. Such testing has resulted in major advances in the dissemination of teratology information, including the identification of an increasing number of teratogens and the understanding of the pathogenesis of birth defects. While mechanistically birth defect prevention will include the understanding of individual genomes and pharmacogenomics, overall, morphological assessment will still be required as an integral part of birth defects research. As the interaction between teratogenic and genetic factors is better understood, it is anticipated that the incidence of most types of defects will substantially be reduced.",31069690,Assessment of Gross Fetal Malformations: The Modernized Wilson Technique and Skeletal Staining.,1,0

"Reduction of adverse drug reaction (ADR) incidence through screening of predisposing human leucocyte antigen (HLA) alleles is a promising approach for many widely used drugs. However, application of these associations has been limited by the cost burden of HLA genotyping. Use of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that can approximate ('tag') HLA alleles of interest has been proposed as a cost-effective and simple alternative to conventional genotyping. However, most reported SNP tags have not been validated and there is concern regarding clinical utility of this approach due to tagging inconsistency across different populations. We assess the ability of 67 previously reported and 378 novel tagging SNPs, identified here in 5 HLA reference panels, to tag 15 ADR-associated HLA alleles in a panel of 955 ethnically diverse samples.

"<b>Background:</b> More than 1.3 million emergency department visits have been associated with adverse drug events (ADEs) in older adults. Increasing Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence in the geriatric population poses an additive risk of ADEs because of the array of psychotropic medications prescribed for AD patients. Scant research has been conducted at a nationwide level on psychotropic-related ADEs in this population. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to determine the incidence and economic burden of psychotropic ADEs in the geriatric AD population compared with the non-AD geriatric population. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted of geriatric AD patients who visited the ED in 2013 with a psychotropic-related ADE to determine the incidence and resource utilization of these events. The relationship between presence of AD and an ADE was analyzed using multiple logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> There were 427 969 Alzheimer's ED visits compared with 20 492 554 ED visits without. Of the AD cases, 1.04% were associated with at least 1 adverse event. AD cases more frequently were admitted as inpatients (64.90% vs 34.92%, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Common drug classes associated with AD-related ADEs were benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and autonomic nervous system-affecting agents (adrenergic agonists, antimuscarinic agents, anticholinergic agents). There was a significantly higher likelihood for Alzheimer's cases to experience any psychotropic-related adverse event (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.20, 1.82). <b>Conclusion and Relevance:</b> Alzheimer's patients more frequently experienced psychotropic-related adverse events and related adverse outcomes than older adults without Alzheimer's.

"In this survey, the correlation between adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in human and animal toxicities was investigated for 393 medicines which were approved in Japan from September 1999 to March 2013. ADRs were collected from each Japanese package insert. Comparable animal toxicities with ADRs were collected by thorough investigation of common technical documents. The results of this survey show that hypertension and/or hypotension were mainly observed in medicines affecting the central nervous system. Hypertension was also observed in antipyretics, analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, vasoconstrictors and agents using antibody. Concordance between human ADRs and animal toxicities was analysed. True-positive rate for hypertension and hypotension is 0.29 and 0.52, respectively. Positive likelihood ratio and inverse negative likelihood ratio are 1.98 and 1.21, respectively, in hypertension and 1.67 and 1.44, respectively, in hypotension. Concordance between human ADRs and animal toxicities is not so high in hypertension and hypotension. Identified mechanisms as on-target for hypertension and hypotension are 29.8% and 30.5%, respectively.

"The range of exogenous agents likely to affect, generally detrimentally, the normal development of the brain and central nervous system defies estimation although the amount of accumulated evidence is enormous. The present review is limited to certain types of chemotherapeutic and ""use-and-abuse"" compounds and environmental agents, exemplified by anesthetic, antiepileptic, sleep-inducing and anxiolytic compounds, nicotine and alcohol, and stress as well as agents of infection; each of these agents have been investigated quite extensively and have been shown to contribute to the etiopathogenesis of serious neuropsychiatric disorders. To greater or lesser extent, all of the exogenous agents discussed in the present treatise have been investigated for their influence upon neurodevelopmental processes during the period of the brain growth spurt and during other phases uptill adulthood, thereby maintaining the notion of critical phases for the outcome of treatment whether prenatal, postnatal, or adolescent. Several of these agents have contributed to the developmental disruptions underlying structural and functional brain abnormalities that are observed in the symptom and biomarker profiles of the schizophrenia spectrum disorders and the fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. In each case, the effects of the exogenous agents upon the status of the affected brain, within defined parameters and conditions, is generally permanent and irreversible.",20553311,"Effects of exogenous agents on brain development: stress, abuse and therapeutic compounds.",1,1

"Toxicity evaluation is an important part of the preclinical safety assessment of new drugs, which is directly related to human health and the fate of drugs. It is of importance to study how to evaluate drug toxicity accurately and economically. The traditional in vitro and in vivo toxicity tests are laborious, time-consuming, highly expensive, and even involve animal welfare issues. Computational methods developed for drug toxicity prediction can compensate for the shortcomings of traditional methods and have been considered useful in the early stages of drug development. Numerous drug toxicity prediction models have been developed using a variety of computational methods. With the advance of the theory of machine learning and molecular representation, more and more drug toxicity prediction models are developed using a variety of machine learning methods, such as support vector machine, random forest, naive Bayesian, back propagation neural network. And significant advances have been made in many toxicity endpoints, such as carcinogenicity, mutagenicity, and hepatotoxicity. In this review, we aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the machine learning based drug toxicity prediction studies conducted in recent years. In addition, we compared the performance of the models proposed in these studies in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, providing a view of the current state-of-the-art in this field and highlighting the issues in the current studies.",30051792,Applications of Machine Learning Methods in Drug Toxicity Prediction.,0,0
"Gastrulation is the process in which the three germ layers are formed that contribute to the formation of all major tissues in the developing embryo. We here review mouse genetic models in which defective gastrulation leads to mesoderm insufficiencies in the embryo. Depending on severity of the abnormalities, the outcomes range from incompatible with embryonic survival to structural birth defects, such as heart defects, spina bifida, or caudal dysgenesis. The combined evidence from the mutant models supports the notion that these congenital anomalies can originate from perturbations of mesoderm specification, epithelial-mesenchymal transition, and mesodermal cell migration. Knowledge about the molecular pathways involved may help to improve strategies for the prevention of major structural birth defects.",25115487,Traffic jam in the primitive streak: the role of defective mesoderm migration in birth defects.,0,0

Using a JHGP24 lymphoblast cell line derived from this patient, metaphase fluorescence in situ hybridization with bacterial artificial chromosome and cosmid probes and subsequent molecular analysis mapped the translocation breakpoint to the nucleotide level. Sequence analysis of the breakpoint junctions revealed the presence of a homologous sequence, GTGGC, along with a single nucleotide substitution and an insertion in der(14), and a single nucleotide deletion in the der(5) chromosome. We also attempted to identify and characterize the transcripts near the breakpoint by 5' and 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends.

"Off-target adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are associated with significant morbidity and costs to the healthcare system, and their occurrence is not predictable based on the known pharmacological action of the drug's therapeutic effect. Off-target ADRs may or may not be associated with immunological memory, although they can manifest with a variety of shared clinical features, including maculopapular exanthema, severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs), angioedema, pruritus and bronchospasm. Discovery of specific genes associated with a particular ADR phenotype is a foundational component of clinical translation into screening programmes for their prevention. In this review, genetic associations of off-target drug-induced ADRs that have a clinical phenotype suggestive of an immunologically mediated process and their mechanisms are highlighted. A significant proportion of these reactions lack immunological memory and current data are informative for these ADRs with regard to disease pathophysiology, therapeutic targets and biomarkers which may identify patients at greatest risk. Although many serious delayed immune-mediated (IM)-ADRs show strong human leukocyte antigen associations, only a small subset have successfully been implemented in screening programmes. More recently, other factors, such as drug metabolism, have been shown to contribute to the risk of the IM-ADR. In the future, pharmacogenomic targets and an understanding of how they interact with drugs to cause ADRs will be applied to drug design and preclinical testing, and this will allow selection of optimal therapy to improve patient safety.",28345177,Pharmacogenomics of off-target adverse drug reactions.,0,1

Structural brain abnormalities are more common in children with CHD than general population. This study details the cognitive, motor and behavioral development of a child with congenital heart disease who is on medical management. In this retrospective descriptive study, abnormalities in neurobehavioral status of infant & children (6-42 months of age) with CHD, who are on medical management were assessed by a standardized neurobehavioral assessment test, BSID-II. Fifty-eight children were included, who were diagnosed as a case of congenital heart disease & confirmed by Colour Doppler echocardiography in the Paediatric Cardiology Department of Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Medical University, Bangladesh. Mean age of the children was 23±13 months (range, 6 to 42 months); M:F = 1:1.9. Among them 22(37.9%) had cyanotic and 36(62.1%) had acyanotic congenital heart disease.

BSID-II showed 23(39.7%) had delayed metal development, 24(41.4%) had motor impairment and 16(27.6%) had non-optimal behavioral performance. Interestingly, infant and young children with acyanotic congenital heart defects were more likely to demonstrate severe neurologic compromise than were those with cyanotic defects. Findings of this study suggest that the prevalence of neurobehavioral abnormalities in infants and young children with congenital heart defects has been under predicted & indicates that delay in closure (surgery/device) puts the patient at an increased risk of neuro-developmental insult.

"Cartap and cypermethrin, which are among the most widely used pesticides in many countries, are considered safe because of their low mammalian toxicity and their low persistence in the environment. However, recent findings of endocrine-disrupting effects and developmental neurotoxicity have raised concerns about the potential ecological impacts of these pesticides. We evaluated the aquatic toxicity of cartap [S,S'-(2-dimethylaminotrimethylene) bis(thiocarbamate), unspecified hydrochloride] and cypermethrin [(RS)-alpha-cyano-3-phenoxybenzyl-(1RS,3RS,1RS,3SR)-3-(2,2-dichlorovinyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropane carboxylate], both individually and combined, on different life stages of the freshwater cladoceran Daphnia magna and a freshwater teleost, Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes). The 96-hr Daphnia median effective concentrations (EC50s) for cartap and cypermethrin were 91.0 microg/L and 0.00061 microg/L, respectively. Rapid recovery of Daphnia was observed after short-term pulsed exposure to cartap and cypermethrin; there were no adverse effects on reproduction or survival 20 d after a 24 hr exposure to cartap up to 1240 microg/L and cypermethrin up to 1.9 microg/L. Chronic continuous exposure (for 21 d) of 7-d-old Daphnia to cypermethrin significantly reduced the intrinsic population growth rate in a concentration-dependent manner. However, because the intrinsic population growth rates were all above zero, populations did not decrease even at the highest experimental concentration of 200 ng/L. Exposure of Daphnia neonates (< 24 hr old) to cypermethrin for 21 d caused significant, sub-lethal reproduction-related problems, such as increased time to first brood, reduced brood size, and reduced total brood number, at 0.0002, 0.002, and 0.2 ng/L cypermethrin, but the intrinsic population growth rate was not significantly affected. Oryzias latipes was relatively more resistant to both pesticides. In particular, embryos appeared to be more resistant than juveniles or adults, which may be partly due to the protective role of the chorion. The incidence of larval fish deformity was significantly higher after a 96 hr exposure to as low as 250 microg/L of cartap or 40 microg/L of cypermethrin. The mixture of both compounds showed no synergistic toxicity. The extremely high acute-to-chronic ratio suggests that the standard acute lethal toxicity assessment might not reflect the true environmental hazards of these frequently used pesticides. Ecological hazard assessments of long-term low dose or pulsed exposures to cartap and cypermethrin may reveal more realistic consequences of these compounds in surface water.",18161574,Aquatic toxicity of cartap and cypermethrin to different life stages of Daphnia magna and Oryzias latipes.,1,1

"Congenital anomalies are a major cause of fetal and neonatal death and of childhood morbidity. Chromosomal and other genetic abnormalities, environmental teratogens and some nutritional deficiencies account for some congenital anomalies but the majority are of unknown etiology. The hypothesis is here proposed that a significant proportion of congenital anomalies and cerebral palsy of unknown etiology are attributable to a monozygotic multiple conception with monochorionic placentation and that these anomalies, even in singletons, may be explained by early, unrecognized or unrecorded loss of one conceptus in a monochorionic monozygotic conception. The pathological mechanism is hemodynamic instability with episodes of acute feto-fetal transfusion that produce ischemic organ impairment in either or both twins. The resultant clinical abnormality will depend on range of severity (fetal death, infant death, congenital anomaly, normal infant), site or combination of sites (which organ[s] present[s] with the congenital anomaly) and timing (early, middle or late in gestation as shown by variation in brain pathology that is observed).",16354495,Causal hypothesis for some congenital anomalies.,0,0

Essentially, eTOXsys consists of a central server that marshals requests to a collection of independent prediction models and offers a single user interface to the whole system. Every of such model lives in a self-contained virtual machine easy to maintain and install. All models produce toxicity-relevant predictions on their own but the results of some can be further integrated and upgrade its scale, yielding in vivo toxicity predictions. Technical aspects related with model implementation, maintenance and documentation are also discussed here.

"Boyden's nomenclature, which was based on postmortem specimens and published in 1955 prior to the advent of computed tomography (CT), is commonly used to describe the normal segmental bronchial anatomy and various abnormalities. However, several additional anomalies have been recognized since that time, and there is some confusion over the names used to describe these anomalies. Several congenital branching anomalies affecting the trachea, main bronchi, and intermediate bronchus have been reported, all of which can be recognized at chest CT but are often overlooked. These anomalies, which probably occur early in fetal life, can be either supernumerary, with defects occurring at 29-30 days gestation, or displaced, with defects occurring later. Tracheobronchial positional anomalies are often associated with other congenital abnormalities but may be isolated. They often are asymptomatic but can be responsible for pulmonary symptoms such as dyspnea, recurrent pneumonia, and hemoptysis. It is essential that these anomalies are recognized prior to lung resection to avoid complications, especially when video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery is performed. In addition, bronchoscopists should be aware of these anomalies before performing diagnostic or therapeutic bronchoscopic procedures.

"A big challenge in pharmacology is the understanding of the underlying mechanisms that cause drug-induced adverse reactions (ADRs), which are in some cases similar to each other regardless of different drug indications, and are in other cases different regardless of same drug indications. The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) provides a valuable resource for pharmacoepidemiology, the study of the uses and the effects of drugs in large human population. However, FAERS is a spontaneous reporting system that inevitably contains noise that deviates the application of conventional clustering approaches. By performing a biclustering analysis on the FAERS data we identified 163 biclusters of drug-induced adverse reactions, counting for 691 ADRs and 240 drugs in total, where the number of ADR occurrences are consistently high across the associated drugs. Medically similar ADRs are derived from several distinct indications for use in the majority (145/163=88%) of the biclusters, which enabled us to interpret the underlying mechanisms that lead to similar ADRs. Furthermore, we compared the biclusters that contain same drugs but different ADRs, finding the cases where the populations of the patients were different in terms of age, sex, and body weight. We applied a biclustering approach to catalogue the relationship between drugs and adverse reactions from a large FAERS data set, and demonstrated a systematic way to uncover the cases different drug administrations resulted in similar adverse reactions, and the same drug can cause different reactions dependent on the patients' conditions.",24534381,Pharmacoepidemiological characterization of drug-induced adverse reaction clusters towards understanding of their mechanisms.,0,1

"With the development of Web 2.0 technology, social media websites have become lucrative but under-explored data sources for extracting adverse drug events (ADEs), which is a serious health problem. Besides ADE, other semantic relation types (e.g., drug indication and beneficial effect) could hold between the drug and adverse event mentions, making ADE relation extraction - distinguishing ADE relationship from other relation types - necessary. However, conducting ADE relation extraction in social media environment is not a trivial task because of the expertise-dependent, time-consuming and costly annotation process, and the feature space's high-dimensionality attributed to intrinsic characteristics of social media data. This study aims to develop a framework for ADE relation extraction using patient-generated content in social media with better performance than that delivered by previous efforts. To achieve the objective, a general semi-supervised ensemble learning framework, SSEL-ADE, was developed. The framework exploited various lexical, semantic, and syntactic features, and integrated ensemble learning and semi-supervised learning. A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of each component of SSEL-ADE and reveal that our proposed framework outperforms most of existing ADE relation extraction methods The SSEL-ADE can facilitate enhanced ADE relation extraction performance, thereby providing more reliable support for pharmacovigilance.

Numbers of corpora lutea were also recorded. Fetuses were weighed and examined for gender, gross external changes, and soft tissue or skeletal alterations. No maternal or fetal deaths occurred. No fragrance ingredient-related clinical signs were observed. Feed consumption, body weight gains, gross tissue changes at necropsy, and caesarean section or litter parameters, as well as fetal developmental morphology, were unaffected by dosages of alpha-iso-methylionone as high as 30 mg/kg/day. Based on these data, maternal and developmental no observed adverse effect levels of equal to or greater than 30 mg/kg/day were established for alpha-iso-methylionone.

"Twenty years ago, chromosomal abnormalities were the only identifiable genetic causes of a small fraction of congenital heart defects (CHD). Today, a de novo or inherited genetic abnormality can be identified as pathogenic in one-third of cases. We refer to them here as monogenic causes, insofar as the genetic abnormality has a readily detectable, large effect. What explains the other two-thirds? This review considers a complex genetic basis. That is, a combination of genetic mutations or variants that individually may have little or no detectable effect contribute to the pathogenesis of a heart defect. Genes in the embryo that act directly in cardiac developmental pathways have received the most attention, but genes in the mother that establish the gestational milieu via pathways related to metabolism and aging also have an effect. A growing body of evidence highlights the pathogenic significance of genetic interactions in the embryo and maternal effects that have a genetic basis. The investigation of CHD as guided by a complex genetic model could help estimate risk more precisely and logically lead to a means of prevention.",28381817,The Complex Genetic Basis of Congenital Heart Defects.,1,0

"The association between folic acid supplementation and birth defects other than neural tube defects remains unclear. We utilized data from a large population-based survey to examine the association between folic acid supplementation and birth defects in Northwestern China. A total of 29,204 women with infants born between 2010 and 2013 were surveyed in Shaanxi province, Northwestern China, using a stratified multistage sampling method. Propensity scores were used to match 9,293 women with optimal folic acid supplementation with 9,293 women with nonoptimal folic acid supplementation, and the effects of optimal folic acid supplementation on birth defects were assessed by a conditional logistic regression model. After propensity score matching, the overall birth defect rate, cardiovascular system defect rate and nervous system defect rate for the women with optimal folic acid supplementation were lower than those for the women with nonoptimal folic acid supplementation (overall birth defects: OR = 0.71, 95% CI = 0.57-0.89, P = 0.003; cardiovascular system defects: OR = 0.65, 95% CI = 0.44-0.96, P = 0.032; nervous system defects: OR = 0.13, 95% CI = 0.02-0.99, P = 0.049). Optimal folic acid supplementation was associated with a decreased prevalence of birth defects, especially in the cardiovascular system and nervous system. Our findings have important implications for birth defect intervention with folic acid supplementation for countries with a high prevalence of birth defects, such as China.",30918271,"A propensity-matched study of the association between optimal folic acid supplementation and birth defects in Shaanxi province, Northwestern China.",0,0

"Congenital parenchymal lung malformations have an estimated incidence at 1:25,000-1:35,000 births. We present a case of this rare congenital abnormality in a 38 year-old male, review the current literature with discussion of proposed causes, malignant potential, and management  strategies. A 38-year-old white male presented with a 4-day history of chronic stable hemoptysis. Social history was notable for a 50-pack-year active smoking history and remote heavy alcohol consumption. Physical examination was normal. Chest radiograph revealed an ill defined right lower  lobe infiltrate. Chest computed tomography demonstrated an irregular, thin-walled, cystic lesion with adjacent nodularity and calcifications. The patient received a right lower lobectomy. Pathologic specimen demonstrated a 10-cm, mostly thin-walled cyst with features suggestive of a congenital  cyst adenomatoid malformation and areas of adenocarcinoma (mixed subtype with acinar and bronchioloalveolar patterns). Congenital cyst adenomatoid malformations have recently been renamed as congenital pulmonary airway malformations and are the most common type of congenital parenchymal lung  malformations. Individuals typically present with recurrent pulmonary infections, pneumothorax, or hemoptysis. The development is controversial but believed to be a result of arrested development of the fetal bronchial tree during the sixth and seventh week of fetal development. Defects in  thyroid transcription factor 1 have also been proposed. With the increasing use and image resolution of ultrasound in modern obstetric practice, congenital pulmonary airway malformations rarely go undetected into adulthood. Management remains controversial; however, most authors agree with  early surgical excision.",21762550,Congenital pulmonary airway malformation: a case report and review of the literature.,1,0

"It is difficult to determine adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in daily complicated clinical practice in which many kinds of drugs are prescribed. We evaluated how well the Naranjo Algorithm (NA) categorized ADRs among suspected ADRs. The Japan Adverse Drug Events (JADE) study was a prospective cohort study of 3459 inpatients. After all suspected ADRs were reported from research assistants, a single physician reviewer independently assigned an NA score to each. After all NA score of suspected ADRs were scored, two physician reviewers discussed and determined ADRs based on the literature. We investigated the sensitivity and specificity of NA and each component to categorize ADRs among suspected ADRs. A total of 1579 suspected ADRs were reported in 962 patients. Physician reviewers determined 997 ADRs. The percentage of ADRs was 94% if the total NA score reached 5. The modified NA consisted of 5 components that showed high classification abilities; its area under the curve (AUC) was 0.92 for categorizing ADRs, the same as the original. When we set the total NA score cut-off value to 5, specificity was 0.95 and sensitivity was 0.59. When we reclassified NA components as binary variables, the specificity increased to 0.98 with a cut-off value of 4 and yielded an AUC of 0.93. In conclusion, we showed that both NA and modified NA could categorize ADRs among suspected ADRs with a high likelihood in daily clinical practice.",29417762,Improving the assessment of adverse drug reactions using the Naranjo Algorithm in daily practice: The Japan Adverse Drug Events Study.,0,1

"The long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterized by a prolonged QT interval, as well as a propensity to develop syncope and sudden cardiac death caused by the malignant polymorphic ventricular arrhythmia called torsades de pointes (TdP). The QT interval is measured from the onset of the QRS complex to the end of the T wave and can be affected by both ventricular conduction velocities as well as by the velocity of repolarization. In most cases, QT prolongation is caused by factors that prolong the duration of the action potential, mainly by delaying the repolarization phase 3. The molecular mechanism is partially known. There are two well described mechanisms: blocking of the ion channel cavity of HERG; or causing an abnormal protein trafficking required for the location of HERG subunits in cell membrane. Both of them impair the I(Kr) current. However the blockade of ion channels is not the only condition to generate TdP. Other factors may play an important role, e.g. myocardium heterogeneity, drug-drug interaction, genetic polymorphism, and Electrolyte disturbances. Several drugs had been subject of withdrawal because QT-prolongation and arrhythmia. Understanding of processes involved in drug-induced QT prolongation is needed for the study and prevention of life-threatening arrhythmias.",20210718,Mechanisms of drug induced QT interval prolongation.,1,1
"Multiple drugs of a new class of cancer treatments called immune checkpoint inhibitors, which work by enabling the immune system to attack tumour cells, have been approved for a variety of indications in recent years. Immune checkpoints, such as cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 and programmed death-1, are part of the normal immune system and regulate immune activation. Treatment with inhibitors of these checkpoints can significantly improve response rates, progression-free survival and overall survival of patients with cancer; it can also result in adverse reactions that present similarly to other conditions. These immune-mediated adverse reactions (IMARs) are most commonly gastrointestinal, respiratory, endocrine or dermatologic. Although patients' presentations may appear similar to other types of cancer therapy, the underlying causes, and consequently their management, may differ. Prompt recognition is critical because, with appropriate management, most IMARs resolve and patients can continue receiving immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. Rarely, these IMARs may be life-threatening and escape detection from the usual evaluations in the emergency environment. Given the unusual spectrum and mechanism of IMARs arising from immune checkpoint inhibitors, emergency departmentED staff require a clear understanding of the evaluation of IMARs to enable them to appropriately assess and treat these patients. Treatment of IMARs, most often with high-dose steroids, differs from chemotherapy-related adverse events and when possible should be coordinated with the treating oncologist.

We can also see the difference in the incidences from 1994-1999 and 2000-2015 time period. The reason for this difference is the methodical change of registration, the Registry of congenital anomalies also receives the notifications about possible anomalies from the report of newborn (even when the report of congenital anomaly was not sent).

"Cancer chemotherapy has a high frequency of side effects, and patients often experience adverse health effects. This review focuses on risk factors and supportive care for the prevention of chemotherapy side effects. 1) Drug-induced interstitial lung disease (DILD) is one of the serious adverse events associated with chemotherapy, and this retrospective study investigated the risk of DILD in Japanese patients with lung cancer. Among the 459 patients who received lung cancer chemotherapy from April 2007 to March 2013, 33 (7.2%) developed chemotherapy-associated DILD. Preexisting interstitial lung disease was a risk factor for DILD [odds ratio (OR)=5.38; 95% confidence interval (CI)=2.47-11.73]. Early death was observed in 10 of the 33 patients who developed DILD. Epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor use (OR=9.26; 95%CI=1.05-81.96) and two or more prior chemotherapy regimens (OR=6.95; 95%CI=1.14-42.35) were identified as poor prognostic factors. 2) The incidence of pemetrexed-induced rash is high. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the efficacy of corticosteroids for pemetrexed-induced rash. Rash developed in 26.9% of patients who received pemetrexed between April 2009 and March 2014. Supplementation with dexamethasone (≥1.5 mg) on days 2 and 3 significantly reduced the incidence of rash compared with no supplementary corticosteroids (39.4% vs. 17.8%, p<0.05). Increasing the corticosteroid dose had no additional effect on pemetrexed-induced rash development. These results suggest that supplementary corticosteroids may prevent pemetrexed-induced rash, and low-dose corticosteroids are sufficient for such prevention.",30381644,[Analysis of Risk Factors for Side Effects and the Establishment of Supportive Therapy during Cancer Chemotherapy].,0,1
"Prostaglandin E1 (alprostadil) is widely used for maintaining the patency of ductus arteriosus in ductus-dependent congenital heart defects in neonates to improve oxygenation.

More severe side effects are brown fat necrosis, cortical hyperostosis, and gastric outlet obstruction, most commonly the result of antral foveolar hyperplasia or hypertrophic pyloric stenosis. We report on an infant with a ductus-dependent congenital heart defect who developed symptoms and sonographic evidence of focal foveolar hyperplasia and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis after prolonged treatment with prostaglandin E1. Gastrointestinal symptoms persisted after corrective cardiac surgery, and pyloromyotomy was required. Study of the case and of available literature showed an association between the total dose of prostaglandin E1 administered and duration of treatment and the development of gastric outlet obstruction. We conclude that if patients are treated with a prostaglandin E1 infusion, careful monitoring for symptoms and signs of gastric outlet obstruction is required.",23521358,Prolonged prostaglandin E1 therapy in a neonate with pulmonary atresia and ventricular septal defect and the development of antral foveolar hyperplasia and hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.,1,1

"Timely identification of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is highly important in the domains of public health and pharmacology. Early discovery of potential ADRs can limit their effect on patient lives and also make drug development pipelines more robust and efficient. Reliable in silico prediction of ADRs can be helpful in this context, and thus, it has been intensely studied. Recent works achieved promising results using machine learning. The presented work focuses on machine learning methods that use drug profiles for making predictions and use features from multiple data sources. We argue that despite promising results, existing works have limitations, especially regarding flexibility in experimenting with different data sets and/or predictive models. We suggest to address these limitations by generalization of the key principles used by the state of the art. Namely, we explore effects of: (1) using knowledge graphs-machine-readable interlinked representations of biomedical knowledge-as a convenient uniform representation of heterogeneous data; and (2) casting ADR prediction as a multi-label ranking problem. We present a specific way of using knowledge graphs to generate different feature sets and demonstrate favourable performance of selected off-the-shelf multi-label learning models in comparison with existing works. Our experiments suggest better suitability of certain multi-label learning methods for applications where ranking is preferred. The presented approach can be easily extended to other feature sources or machine learning methods, making it flexible for experiments tuned toward specific requirements of end users. Our work also provides a clearly defined and reproducible baseline for any future related experiments.",28968655,Facilitating prediction of adverse drug reactions by using knowledge graphs and multi-label learning models.,0,1

"<b>Introduction</b>: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of differentiating into all types of cells in the body and so provide suitable toxicology screening systems even for hard-to-obtain human tissues. Since hPSCs can also be generated from differentiated cells and current gene editing technologies allow targeted genome modifications, hPSCs can be applied for drug toxicity screening both in normal and disease-specific models. Targeted hPSC differentiation is still a challenge but cardiac, neuronal or liver cells, and complex cellular models are already available for practical applications. <b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review new gene-editing and cell-biology technologies to generate sensitive toxicity screening systems based on hPSCs. Then the authors present the use of undifferentiated hPSCs for examining embryonic toxicity and discuss drug screening possibilities in hPSC-derived models. The authors focus on the application of human cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cultures in toxicity testing, and discuss the recent possibilities for drug screening in a 'body-on-a-chip' model system. <b>Expert opinion</b>: hPSCs and their genetically engineered derivatives provide new possibilities to investigate drug toxicity in human tissues. The key issues in this regard are still the selection and generation of proper model systems, and the interpretation of the results in understanding <i>in vivo</i> drug effects.",30526128,Application of human pluripotent stem cells and pluripotent stem cell-derived cellular models for assessing drug toxicity.,0,0
"Zika virus infection during pregnancy can cause serious brain abnormalities, but the full range of adverse outcomes is unknown (1). To better understand the impact of birth defects resulting from Zika virus infection, the CDC surveillance case definition established in 2016 for birth defects potentially related to Zika virus infection* (2) was retrospectively applied to population-based birth defects surveillance data collected during 2013-2014 in three areas before the introduction of Zika virus (the pre-Zika years) into the World Health Organization's Region of the Americas (Americas) (3). These data, from Massachusetts (2013), North Carolina (2013), and Atlanta, Georgia (2013-2014), included 747 infants and fetuses with one or more of the birth defects meeting the case definition (pre-Zika prevalence = 2.86 per 1,000 live births). Brain abnormalities or microcephaly were the most frequently recorded (1.50 per 1,000), followed by neural tube defects and other early brain malformations<sup>†</sup> (0.88), eye abnormalities without mention of a brain abnormality (0.31), and other consequences of central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction without mention of brain or eye abnormalities (0.17).

Although the ascertainment methods differed, this finding was approximately 20 times higher than the proportion of one or more of the same birth defects among pregnancies during the pre-Zika years.

"Drug-induced QT prolongation (DI-LQT), through its associated arrhythmias, is a leading cause of drugs being withdrawn from the market. As a consequence, the US FDA and other regulatory agencies are mandating that all new drugs go through a so-called 'Thorough QT' (TQT) study to evaluate the potential for 'QT liability', specifically the potential for a drug to cause a discernible increase in the QT interval. Several genetic factors that modulate the risk of DI-LQT have been discovered. These are genes responsible for the congenital long QT syndrome, drug metabolism genes (mainly CYP2D6 and CYP3A4), and genes in other regulatory pathways. Here, we briefly review the links between genetic variants and drug-induced QT risk, and propose approaches to consider for using pharmacogenetics in planning and analyzing TQT studies.",16771601,Pharmacogenetic issues in thorough QT trials.,1,1

"Canine congenital malformations are structural or functional abnormalities of organs present at birth that possibly interfere with the viability of newborns, thus contributing to neonatal mortality. This study evaluated and described the incidence of congenital malformations in neonatal dogs and determined the mortality rates among those affected. Of the 178 litters and 803 newborns included in the study, 24.7% (44/178) of the litters presented neonates with congenital malformations. The total rate of neonates that presented malformations was 6.7% (64/803). The total mortality rate in newborns with congenital defects was 5.4% (44/803), representing 68.7% (44/64) of the deaths observed among those affected. The early (0-2 days old) and late (3-30 days old) mortality rates among the affected neonates were 61.4% (27/44) and 38.6% (17/44), respectively.

"Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are multi-targeted anti-cancer agents effective in the treatment of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), imatinib-resistant gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) and pancreatic cancer (PC). Targeting and inhibiting a wide range of oncogenically relevant receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), TKIs have been the golden standard treatment of several types of cancer. The cardiotoxicity of TKIs, however, has also emerged alongside their anti-cancer potencies and has attracted research attention. Over the past few years significant progress has been made in developing a deeper understanding of aspects such as extent of cardiotoxicity, prognostic implications and survival predictions, toxicological mechanisms, and potential cardioprotective therapies. In this review we focus on a typical TKI sunitinib and summarize the up-to-date knowledge of sunitinib-induced cardiac abnormalities reported in clinical studies, weighing their implications of prognostic values.

"Genetic testing has multiple clinical applications including disease risk assessment, diagnosis, and pharmacogenomics. Pharmacogenomics can be utilized to predict whether a pharmacologic therapy will be effective or to identify patients at risk for treatment-related toxicity. Although genetic tests are typically ordered for a distinct clinical purpose, the genetic variants that are found may have additional implications for either disease or pharmacology. This review will address multiple examples of germline genetic variants that are informative for both disease and pharmacogenomics. The discussed relationships are diverse. Some of the agents are targeted for the disease-causing genetic variant, while others, although not targeted therapies, have implications for the disease they are used to treat. It is also possible that the disease implications of a genetic variant are unrelated to the pharmacogenomic implications. Some of these examples are considered clinically actionable pharmacogenes, with evidence-based, pharmacologic treatment recommendations, while others are still investigative as areas for additional research. It is important that clinicians are aware of both the disease and pharmacogenomic associations of these germline genetic variants to ensure patients are receiving comprehensive personalized care.",28887371,Germline genetic variants with implications for disease risk and therapeutic outcomes.,1,1

"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy substantially reduces the risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV, but concerns exist about the potential for teratogenic effects. This analysis was undertaken to explore the relation between ART in pregnancy and birth defects in infants born to HIV-infected women in the United Kingdom and Ireland between 1990 and 2003. Comprehensive obstetric and pediatric HIV surveillance is carried out through the National Study of HIV in Pregnancy and Childhood. Congenital abnormalities were reported in 101 of 3172 infants (100 of 3120 pregnancies). There was no statistically significant association between the prevalence of congenital abnormalities and exposure to ART overall: 3.4% (90 of 2657 pregnancies) in exposed pregnancies and 2.2% (10 of 463 pregnancies) in nonexposed pregnancies (P = 0.166); prevalence was similar whether or not exposure occurred in the first trimester: 3.7% (20 of 541 pregnancies) after early exposure and 3.1% (80 of 2579 pregnancies) without early exposure (P = 0.476). There was also no significant association with type of ART in early pregnancy (ie, highly active antiretroviral therapy [HAART] vs. mono- or dual therapy, HAART with protease inhibitor and/or nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor). The lack of association was maintained after adjustment for potential confounding factors. These findings are reassuring, but continued monitoring is essential in view of the increasing number of women on therapy at conception and the likely continuing diversity of drug regimens.",16763496,"Antiretroviral therapy and congenital abnormalities in infants born to HIV-1-infected women in the United Kingdom and Ireland, 1990 to 2003.",1,0

The side effects of rapamycin can limit its usefulness, but their management and evolution are rarely reported in clinical trials. We performed a retrospective cohort study in patients transplanted before December 31, 2008 and who received rapamycin to replace calcineurin inhibitors. In 219 patients studied, 98% presented ≥1 side effects after starting rapamycin. Side effects occurring in ≥10% of patients were dyslipidemia (52%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 45-59%), peripheral edema (37%, 95%CI: 31-43%), cytopenia (36%, 95% CI: 30-42%), acne (29%, 95% CI: 23-35%), proteinuria (23%, 95% CI: 17-29%), and oral ulcers 14% (95% CI: 10-18%).

"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to contribute to the literature by assessing factors that typically engender adverse drug reactions (ADRs) jeopardizing medical safety. These factors are population knowledge, clarity in disclosure of the risks inhering ADRs and ADRs incidence. It seeks to minimize negative effect by early identification of drug reactions. Design/methodology/approach On the one hand, the study employs a model that shows relationships between various factors, and on the other hand, ADRs medical safety in the public healthcare sector. Findings Clarity of consultancy services in public healthcare significantly impact ADR medical safety. Population and healthcare provider education on ADRs medical safety are necessities. Implementation of an ADR reporting system in every healthcare institute is essential. This helps service providers to give a clear and accurate information to patients. It also makes patients more aware of consequences of ADRs. Research limitations/implications Time, place and sampling method are found to be the main study limitations. Researchers should take into their consideration the significant relationships between the factors and ADRs medical safety to improve level of awareness in the healthcare public sector. Practical implications Ways to improve ADR medical safety in healthcare sector are underscored. Healthcare service providers and professionals need to take into account the stipulated study factors in order to improve medical safety and reduce unnecessary medical costs.

"We conducted a prospective study to assess the value of high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) in identifying facial nerve variations in patients with congenital aural atresia and to determine how they affect otologic reconstruction surgery. Our study population was made up of 65 patients (69 ears) aged 6 to 22 years (mean: 13.7) without regard to sex. They were classified into three groups according to their scores on the Jahrsdoerfer grading scale: 46 ears scored 8 or more, 18 had a score of 6 or 7, and 5 scored 5 or less. The course of each facial nerve as determined intraoperatively was compared with the preoperative HRCT findings. HRCT revealed that in most of the facial nerves, the tympanic segments overlapped the oval window partly or completely; this was confirmed by surgical findings in most cases. Three of the 69 facial nerves (4.3%) were bifurcated. It is interesting that in 1 ear in which the facial nerve completely covered the oval window, the angle of the second genu was acute, exhibiting a ""sharp turn.""

"The process of discovering novel drugs to treat diseases requires a long time and high cost. It is important to understand side effects of drugs as well as their therapeutic effects, because these can seriously damage the patients due to unexpected actions of the derived candidate drugs. In order to overcome these limitations, computational methods for predicting the therapeutic effects and side effects have been proposed. In particular, text mining is a widely used technique in the field of systems biology, because it can discover hidden relationships between drugs, genes and diseases from a large amount of literature data. Compared with in vivo/in vitro experiments, text mining derives meaningful results with less time and cost. In this study, we propose an algorithm for predicting novel drug-phenotype associations and drug-side effect associations using topic modeling and natural language processing (NLP). We extract sentences in which drugs and genes co-occur from the abstracts of the literature and identify words that describe the relationship between them using NLP. Considering the characteristics of the identified words, we determine if the drug has an up-regulation effect or a down-regulation effect on the gene. Based on genes that affect drugs and their regulatory relationships, we group the frequently occurring genes and regulatory relationships into topics, and build a drug-topic probability matrix by calculating the score that the drug will have a topic using topic modeling. Using the matrix, a classifier is constructed for predicting the novel indications and side effects of drugs considering the characteristics of known drug-phenotype associations or drug-side effect associations. The proposed method predicts both indications and side effects with a single algorithm, and it can exclude drugs with serious side effects or side effects that patients do not want to experience from among the candidate drugs provided for the treatment of the phenotype. Furthermore, lists of novel candidate drugs for phenotypes and side effects can be continuously updated with our algorithm every time a document is added. More than a thousand documents are produced per day, and it is possible for our algorithm to efficiently derive candidate drugs because it requires less cost than the existing drug repositioning methods.

"Drug-induced nephrotoxicity is a major cause of acute kidney injury, and thus detecting the potential for nephrotoxicity early in the drug development process is critical. Various urinary biomarkers exhibit different patterns following drug-induced injury, which may provide greater information than traditional biomarkers like serum creatinine. In this study, we developed a multiscale quantitative systems pharmacology model relating drug exposure to proximal tubule (PT) epithelial cell injury and subsequently to expression of multiple urinary biomarkers and organ-level functional changes. We utilized urinary kidney injury molecule-1 (Kim-1), alpha glutathione S-transferase, albumin (αGST), glucose, and urine volume time profiles as well as serum creatinine and histopathology data obtained from rats treated with the nephrotoxicant cisplatin to develop the model. Although the model was developed using single-dose response to cisplatin, the model predicted the serum creatinine response to multidose cisplatin regimens. Further, using only the urinary Kim-1 response to gentamicin (a nephrotoxicant with a distinctly different injury time course than cisplatin), the model detected and predicted mild to moderate PT injury, as confirmed with histopathology, even when serum creatinine was unchanged. Thus, the model is generalizable, and can be used to deconvolute the underlying degree and time course of drug-induced PT injury and renal dysfunction from a small number of urinary biomarkers, and may provide a tool to determine optimal dosing regimens that minimize renal injury.",29126144,Multiscale Mathematical Model of Drug-Induced Proximal Tubule Injury: Linking Urinary Biomarkers to Epithelial Cell Injury and Renal Dysfunction.,0,1

"Air pollution exposure has been increasing extensively and there are evidence suggesting that exposure to air pollution during pregnancy can lead to congenital defects in the offspring. Recent findings suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) might play important roles in the pathogenesis of developmental defects. However, the miRNAs profile pattern in the air pollution-exposed embryos remains unknown. RNA sequencing was performed to determine the differentially expressed miRNAs in the rat embryos (gestation day 9) with or without air pollution exposure. The potential functions and the associated mechanisms of these differentially expressed miRNAs were determined using Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and Gene Ontology (GO) analyses. The regulatory networks of mRNA-miRNA interactions were also reconstructed. As compared with the control group, a total of 291 miRNAs were differentially expressed in the rat embryos from the air pollution-exposed group, in which 204 and 87 miRNAs were significantly downregulated and upregulated, respectively. These miRNAs were predicted to deregulate mitotic spindle organization, cellular respiration, glycolate metabolism, and proteasome. Extensive regulation of target genes by miR-346, miR-504, miR-214-3p and miR-1224 was also predicted.

"Little is known epidemiologically about laterality defects. Using data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS), a large multi-site case-control study of birth defects, we analyzed prevalence and selected characteristics in children born with laterality defects born from 1998 to 2007. We identified 517 nonsyndromic cases (378 heterotaxy, 73.1%; 139 situs inversus totalis [SIT], 26.9%) resulting in an estimated birth prevalence of 1.1 per 10,000 live births (95% confidence interval 1.0–1.2). Prevalence did not differ significantly across sites, over time, or by inclusion of pregnancy termination. Laterality defects were more common among preterm cases compared to term cases, and in children born to mothers who were non-white or younger than 20 years compared to white mothers or those age 25–29 years. The distribution of associated cardiac and extra-cardiac defects, excluding the expected heterotaxy anomalies, varied by type of laterality defect. Cases with heterotaxy were significantly more likely than those with SIT to have double outlet right ventricle, atrioventricular canal defects, pulmonary stenosis, non-tetralogy of Fallot pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect, totally and partially anomalous pulmonary venous return; also more likely to have orofacial clefts, esophageal atresia, bowel atresias, and omphalocele, though not reaching statistical significance. Relatively more common among cases with SIT were Dandy- Walker malformation, anotia/microtia, and limb deficiency. The similarity in the demographic characteristics of heterotaxy and SIT supports the hypothesis that they are part of a continuum of abnormal left-right axis patterning.

Best known for rockets, space shuttles, astronauts and engineering, the space program has also delivered some serious medical science. Optimized suspension culture in NASA's specialized suspension culture devices, known as rotating wall vessels, uniquely maintains Phase I and Phase II drug metabolizing pathways in hepatocytes for weeks in cell culture. Previously prohibitively expensive, new materials and 3D printing techniques have the potential to make the NASA rotating wall vessel available inexpensively on an industrial scale. Here we address the tradeoffs inherent in the rotating wall vessel, limitations of alternative approaches for drug metabolism studies, and the market to be addressed. Better pre-clinical drug testing has the potential to significantly reduce the morbidity and mortality of one of the most common problems in modern medicine: adverse events related to pharmaceuticals.",27183841,Is There a Space-Based Technology Solution to Problems with Preclinical Drug Toxicity Testing?,0,0
"Neonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a drug withdrawal syndrome that can occur following prenatal exposure to opioids (1). NAS surveillance in the United States is based largely on diagnosis codes in hospital discharge data, without validation of these codes or case confirmation. During 2004-2014, reported NAS incidence increased from 1.5 to 8.0 per 1,000 U.S. hospital births (2), based on International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-CM) diagnosis codes identified in hospital discharge data, without case confirmation. However, little is known about how well these codes identify NAS or how the October 1, 2015, transition from ICD-9-CM to the tenth revision of ICD-CM (ICD-10-CM) codes affected estimated NAS incidence. This report describes a pilot project in Illinois, New Mexico, and Vermont to use birth defects surveillance infrastructure to obtain state-level, population-based estimates of NAS incidence among births in 2015 (all three states) and 2016 (Illinois) using hospital discharge records and other sources (varied by state) with case confirmation, and to evaluate the validity of NAS diagnosis codes used by each state. Wide variation in NAS incidence was observed across the three states. In 2015, NAS incidence for Illinois, New Mexico, and Vermont was 3.0, 7.5, and 30.8 per 1,000 births, respectively. Among evaluated diagnosis codes, those with the highest positive predictive values (PPVs) for identifying confirmed cases of NAS, based on a uniform case definition, were drug withdrawal syndrome in a newborn (ICD-9-CM code 779.5; state range = 58.6%-80.2%) and drug withdrawal, infant of dependent mother (ICD-10-CM code P96.1; state range = 58.5%-80.2%). The methods used to assess NAS incidence in this pilot project might help inform other states' NAS surveillance efforts.",30789880,"Leveraging Existing Birth Defects Surveillance Infrastructure to Build Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome Surveillance Systems - Illinois, New Mexico, and Vermont, 2015-2016.",0,0

"Cubilin and megalin are multiligand receptors that mediate uptake of extracellular ligands. Their function has extensively been studied in the kidney where they play a key role in vitamin B12 and vitamin D homeostasis. Amnionless is a plasma membrane protein that binds to cubilin in various epithelia; the interaction cubilin-amnionless in the gut is crucial for dietary vitamin B12 uptake. Studies in patients with gene defects in these receptors, and animal models with inactivated cubilin, megalin or amnionless suggest an important role in embryonic development and normal growth.

"Statins are widely used to prevent major cardiovascular events by lowering serum cholesterol. There is evidence that statins have pleiotropic effects-that is, cholesterol-independent effects-that may also confer protection from cardiovascular disease and potentially numerous other pathologies, including cancer. Statins also have a number of well described adverse effects, including myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, liver damage, and type 2 diabetes. This paper examines the evidence of epigenetic modifications as a contributory factor to the pleiotropic and adverse effects of statins. In vitro and animal studies have shown that statins can inhibit histone deacetylase activity and increase histone acetylation. Similarly, there is evidence that statins may inhibit both histone and DNA methyltransferases and subsequently demethylate histone residues and DNA, respectively. These changes have been shown to alter expression of various genes, including tumor suppressor genes and genes thought to have anti-atherosclerotic actions. Statins have also been shown to influence the expression of numerous microRNAs that suppress the translation of proteins involved in tumorigenesis and vascular function. Whether the adverse effects of statins may also have an epigenetic component has been less widely studied, although there is evidence that microRNA expression may be altered in statin-induced muscle and liver damage. As epigenetics and microRNAs influence gene expression, these changes could contribute to the pleiotropic and adverse effects of statins and have long-lasting effects on the health of statin users.",28576976,Pleiotropic and Adverse Effects of Statins-Do Epigenetics Play a Role?,0,0
"As technology improves and becomes more widely accessible, more subclinical congenital malformations are being detected. Using a cohort of 1,780,156 pregnant women and their offspring nested in the 2000-2013 US Medicaid Analytic eXtract, we contrasted time trends in malformations which do not necessarily present with overt clinical symptoms early in life and are more likely to be diagnosed via imaging (secundum atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary artery anomalies, pulmonary valve stenosis, hydrocephalus) with trends in malformations that are unlikely to escape clinical diagnosis (tetralogy of Fallot, coarctation of the aorta, transposition of the great vessels, hypoplastic left heart syndrome, oral cleft, abdominal wall defect). Logistic regression was used to account for trends in risk factors while assessing the impact of increased screening intensity. Prevalence of the diagnosis of secundum atrial septal defect rose from 2.3‰ in 2000-2001 to 7.5‰ in 2012-2013, of patent ductus arteriosus from 1.9‰ to 4.1‰, and of ventricular septal defect from 3.6‰ to 4.5‰. Trends were not explained by changes in the prevalence of risk factors but were attenuated when accounting for screening tests. The other malformations showed no temporal trends.

"An Adverse Event Following Immunization (AEFI) is an adverse reaction to a vaccination that goes above and beyond the usual side effects associated with vaccinations. One serious AEFI related to the smallpox vaccine is myopericarditis. Metabolomics involves the study of the low molecular weight metabolite profile of cells, tissues, and biological fluids, and provides a functional readout of the phenotype. Metabolomics may help identify a particular metabolic signature in serum of subjects who are predisposed to developing AEFIs. The goal of this study was to identify metabolic markers that may predict the development of adverse events following smallpox vaccination. Serum samples were collected from military personnel prior to and following receipt of smallpox vaccine. The study population included five subjects who were clinically diagnosed with myopericarditis, 30 subjects with asymptomatic elevation of troponins, and 31 subjects with systemic symptoms following immunization, and 34 subjects with no AEFI, serving as controls. Two-hundred pre- and post-smallpox vaccination sera were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics using <sup>1</sup>H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Baseline (pre-) and post-vaccination samples from individuals who experienced clinically verified myocarditis or asymptomatic elevation of troponins were more metabolically distinguishable pre- and post-vaccination compared to individuals who only experienced systemic symptoms, or controls. Metabolomics profiles pre- and post-receipt of vaccine differed substantially when an AEFI resulted. This study is the first to describe pre- and post-vaccination metabolic profiles of subjects who developed an adverse event following immunization.

"Although most drugs are used to treat chronic or pregnancy-induced conditions during pregnancy and lactation, very few are studied in pregnant or breastfeeding women. The information we have on drugs taken during pregnancy and lactation is usually obtained after market approval through published case reports or case series and from pregnancy exposure or retrospective birth defect registries. Furthermore, generic drugs approved for use in this vulnerable population may be approved based on results from a male trial population. This disregards the changes that can occur during pregnancy which can affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs. In an effort to improve the information provided to prescribers, in 2008 the United States Food and Drug Administration proposed a change in product labelling where information from pregnancy exposure registries would be required. As of 2009, European Medicines Agency requires additional statements on use during pregnancy within drug labelling information. In Canada, it is anticipated that the efficacy and safety of drugs in pregnancy will be included under the Drug Safety and Effectiveness Network initiative, and that this will offer a unified approach for such assessments.

"The objective of these studies was to evaluate the reproductive and developmental toxicity of a commercial fluoroalkylethanol mixture, which is an intermediate in the production of fluorotelomers. The test substance was administered daily by gavage to Sprague-Dawley rats as a suspension in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose. In a one-generation reproductive toxicity study, rats (20 per sex per group) were given dosages of 0, 25, 100, or 250 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for a period of 74 days prior to cohabitation, and during mating, gestation, and lactation. Body weights, feed consumption, clinical signs, gross pathology, sperm parameters, estrous cyclicity, and reproductive performance were evaluated for the P1 generation. The F1 offspring were.evaluated during the lactation period for growth and survival and given a gross pathology examination at weaning. A subset of the offspring were retained; body weights, feed consumption, clinical signs, and age at onset of vaginal opening and preputial separation were evaluated, and gross pathology was performed on postnatal day 60. In the developmental toxicity study, groups of time-mated Sprague-Dawley female rats were given the test substance as a suspension in 0.5% aqueous methylcellulose at daily dosages of 0, 50, 200, or 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1) by gavage on gestation days 6-20. During the in-life portion of the study, growth parameters and clinical observations were made. On gestation day 21, dams were euthanized, and the thoracic and abdominal viscera were examined. The uterine contents were removed and examined, and fetuses were evaluated for any alterations. In the reproduction study, litter size at birth, number of live pups per litter on day 0 and 4 of lactation, and pup weights during lactation were reduced in groups administered > or =100 mg kg(-1) day(-1). No other reproductive parameters were affected. There were no adverse reproductive effects observed at 25 mg kg(-1) day(-1). In the developmental toxicity study, reduced maternal body weight parameters, increased perineal fur staining, and increased fetal skeletal alterations were observed at 500 mg kg(-1) day(-1). There was no maternal or developmental toxicity at 50 or 200 mg kg(-1) day(-1). Under the conditions of the studies, the no-observed adverse effect levels for this mixture were 25 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for subchronic toxicity and reproductive parameters and 200 mg kg(-1) day(-1) for developmental toxicity end points.

"A model of sling-trained, conscious mongrel dogs instrumented with telemetric arterial pressure transmitters and ECG leads was validated for assessment of the QT-RR interval relationship at clinically used free and total plasma concentrations of positive and negative standards with known outcomes. The beat-to-beat technique for assessing the dynamic boundaries of the individual cardiac cycles was compared to the same data with typically used averaging techniques and corrections applied. Positive standards E-4031, cisapride, terodiline, and terfenadine showed increased sensitivity toward detection at clinically relevant levels when an outlier analysis of beats beyond the normal autonomic boundary is applied. Since methods to correct the QT interval for heart rate are often confounded with changes in autonomic state, a validation of the changes with reflex tachycardia induced by vasodilatation after nitroprusside and reflex bradycardia induced by sudden vasoconstriction with phenylephrine where shown to be differentiated from direct effects of repolarization with E-4031. These changes were also demonstrated to be identical to effects observed in humans after standing or challenged with a similar dose of phenylephrine. The conscious dog is also a sensitive model for studying the arrhythmia liability induced by beat-to-beat changes in cardiac ECG restitution (the relationship between QT and TQ intervals) and hysteresis. However, some caveats based on observations may need to be considered due to inherent differences in QT intervals and sinus arrhythmia between canines and humans.",18938261,Assessing QT prolongation in conscious dogs: validation of a beat-to-beat method.,1,1
"Advances in HIV therapy and mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) prophylaxis have led to increasing use of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy. Highly active antiretroviral therapy in pregnancy has been associated with prematurity, pre-eclampsia and gestational diabetes. Women may be at increased risk of nevirapine-associated hepatotoxicity but whether or not pregnancy is an additional risk is uncertain. Although animal studies suggest a possibility of congenital abnormalities with specific antiretrovirals, such as efavirenz, results from registries and cohort studies do not support an excess of congenital malformations associated with in utero antiretroviral exposure. Concerns regarding the health of uninfected, antiretroviral-exposed children include the potential for cancers, mitochondrial disease and haematological abnormalities. However, the absence of any excess mortality in large observational cohort studies of uninfected, antiretroviral therapy-exposed children born to HIV-infected women is reassuring. Based on current knowledge, the immense benefits of antiretroviral prophylaxis in reducing the risk of MTCT, far outweigh the potential for adverse effects.",15794723,The safety of antiretroviral drugs in pregnancy.,1,1

"Older adults are about four to seven times more likely than younger persons to experience adverse drug events (ADEs) that cause hospitalization, especially if they are women and take multiple medications. The prevalence of drug-related hospitalizations has been reported to be as high as 31%, with large heterogeneity between different studies, depending on study setting (all hospital admissions or only acute hospital admissions), study population (entire hospital, specific wards, selected population and/or age groups), type of drug-related problem measured (adverse drug reaction or ADE), method of data collection (chart review, spontaneous reporting or database research) and method and definition used to detect ADEs. The higher risk of drug-related hospitalizations in older adults is mainly caused by age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, a higher number of chronic conditions and polypharmacy, which is often associated with the use of potentially inappropriate drugs. Other factors that have been involved are errors related to prescription or administration of drugs, medication non-adherence and inadequate monitoring of pharmacological therapies. A few commonly used drugs are responsible for the majority of emergency hospitalizations in older subjects, i.e. warfarin, oral antiplatelet agents, insulin and oral hypoglycaemic agents, central nervous system agents.

"<b>Background</b> Congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH) has different clinical presentations depending on whether it is right sided (R-CDH) or left sided (L-CDH). Some have suggested that L-CDH and R-CDH may represent different syndromic phenotypes. This theory would be indirectly supported if different nondiaphragmatic anomalies were associated with laterality. We assessed whether CDH laterality is associated with specific types of nondiaphragmatic anomalies. <b>Methods</b> Cases of CDH were retrospectively identified from five centers, and associated congenital anomalies, prenatal diagnosis, demographics, birth characteristics, and side of the CDH were analyzed. CDH characteristics were summarized according to the absence (isolated) or presence (complex) of nondiaphragmatic malformations. <b>Results</b> Among 228 neonates with CDH, 140 (61%) had isolated CDH and 88 (39%) had complex CDH. Complex CDH was significantly associated with being small for gestational age (odds ratio [95% confidence interval, CI]: 8.3 [1.9-35.7]; <i>p</i> = 0.005) and having L-CDH (odds ratio [95% CI]: 3.6 [1.5-8.9]; <i>p</i> = 0.005).

"As elevated levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α) are associated with disease severity in psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, TNF-α antagonists are being used to treat moderate to severe disease in patients who have contraindications, fail to respond or develop side effects to conventional systemic therapies. It is of utmost importance to be well versed with the possible adverse effects and contraindications of TNF-α antagonists so that they can be used effectively and safely. Many of their adverse effects have been well studied in patients of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and may not be completely applicable in psoriasis. This is because patients with RA and IBD are on multiple immunosuppressants while those with psoriasis are mostly receiving single systemic therapy and often have comorbidities that distinguish them from those with RA or IBD. Also, some of the side effects are still controversial and debated. Long-term prospective randomized controlled studies are needed to better understand the associated risk in patients of psoriasis. Baseline screening and periodic monitoring during treatment can reduce and help in early identification and appropriate management of the adverse outcomes. This article reviews the side effects known to be associated with TNF-α antagonists, their pathomechanisms and management guidelines.

"The purpose of this investigation was to define the sensitivity and specificity of the canine telemetry assay for detecting drug-induced QT interval prolongation. Data from twelve studies generated in the QT PRODACT project were used in this investigation. The study design was a 4x4 Latin square cross-over design and included the following drugs: MK-499, E-4031, terfenadine, haloperidol, cisapride, bepridil, propranolol, diphenhydramine, captopril, verapamil, amoxicillin, and ciprofloxacin. The estimated root squared error of the model, which estimated the slope of the QT-RR relationships for each animal, for all dogs during the pre-dosing period was 5.45%. Using the QT-RR model, the sensitivity and specificity in each cutoff value that judges QT prolongation were estimated based on the experiment errors and measurement errors in the 12 studies. When the cutoff value was 5%, the sensitivity in 10% prolongation was 0.978 and the specificity in 0% was 0.996. In conclusion, it was judged that a 5% cutoff value for changes in heart rate corrected QT interval using the canine telemetry assay is practical, and the sensitivity and specificity of the telemetry assay are very high when using the analytical method presented here. Based upon this information, the canine telemetry assay using the individual subject heart rate correction model is recommended as a sensitive test system for the in vivo assessment of risk for QT interval prolongation.",16493192,QT PRODACT: sensitivity and specificity of the canine telemetry assay for detecting drug-induced QT interval prolongation.,1,1

"Congenital heart disease (CHD) is a type of birth defects due to the abnormal development of heart and blood vessels during embryonic stage. Studies indicate that the etiology of CHD is complicated. Genetic and epigenetic mechanisms including chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations, nucleic acid modifications, non-coding RNAs may play important roles in CHD. At present, genetic mechanisms such as chromosome abnormality and gene mutation have been widely used in the diagnosis and treatment of clinical diseases. However, the application of genetic and epigenetic modification in diagnosis and treatment of CHD still need further research.

"OBJECTIVE Although endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) with choroid plexus cauterization (CPC) has gained increasing prominence in the management of hydrocephalus caused by intraventricular hemorrhage of prematurity, the rates of long-term shunt independence remain low. Furthermore, limited evidence is available to identify infants who might benefit from the procedure. The authors tested the hypothesis that elevated venous pressure that results from comorbid cardiac disease might predispose patients to ETV/CPC failure and shunt dependence. METHODS A retrospective analysis was performed on a consecutive series of 48 infants with hydrocephalus who underwent ETV/CPC and also underwent preoperative echocardiography between 2007 and 2014. Comorbid cardiac abnormalities that are known to result in elevated right heart pressure were reviewed. Associations between ETV/CPC success and the presence of pulmonary hypertension, right ventricular hypertrophy, left-to-right shunting, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus were determined using multivariate logistic regression analysis. RESULTS Of the 48 children who met the inclusion criteria, ETV/CPC failed in 31 (65%). In univariate analysis, no single echocardiogram abnormality was associated with shunt failure, but the presence of 2 or more concurrent echocardiogram abnormalities was associated with ETV/CPC failure (17 [85%] of 20 vs 14 [50%] of 28, respectively; p = 0.018). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, when the authors adjusted for the child's ETV success score, the presence of 2 abnormalities remained independently associated with poor outcome (2 or more echocardiogram abnormalities, OR 0.13, 95% CI 0.01-0.7, p = 0.032; ETV success score, OR 1.1, 95% CI 1-1.2, p = 0.05). CONCLUSIONS In this study, cardiac abnormalities were inversely associated with the success of ETV/CPC in infants with hydrocephalus of prematurity. ETV/CPC might not be as efficacious in patients with significant cardiac anomalies. These results provide a basis for future efforts to stratify surgical candidacy for ETV/CPC on the basis of comorbid abnormalities. Proper cardiac physiological pressure monitoring might help elucidate the relationship between cardiac abnormalities and hydrocephalus.",29125447,Multiple echocardiography abnormalities associated with endoscopic third ventriculostomy failure.,0,0

Herein, we report a complete toxicological safety assessment of DVD for clinical use. The study of toxicity, genetic toxicity (mammalian erythrocyte micronucleus assay, mice sperm abnormality test and in vivo chromosome aberration test of mammalian bone marrow), 90-day sub-chronic toxicity and teratogenicity test were performed. In the acute oral toxicity tests, median lethal dose, LD50, was more than 2378mg/kg body weight in Sprague Dawley rats (1025mg/kg body weight in ICR mice). The testing results for three terms of mutagenicity toxicity (mouse chromosome aberration, erythrocyte micronucleus and sperm abnormality) were all negative at 128-512mg/kg body weight. For 90-day feeding of DVD at the dosage of 10mg/kg body weight in both male and female SD rats, no signs of toxicological effects were detected. Meanwhile, for teratogenicity test in female SD rats at the dosage of 37mg/kg body weight, there were no toxicological signs observed.

"Treatment-related toxicity in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) can not only be life threatening but may also affect relapse risk. In 240 patients, we determined whether toxicities were related to 16 polymorphisms in genes linked to the pharmacodynamics of ALL chemotherapy, adjusting for age, race (self-reported or via ancestry-informative markers), sex, and disease risk group (lower- vs higher-risk therapy). Toxicities (gastrointestinal, infectious, hepatic, and neurologic) were assessed in each treatment phase. During the induction phase, when drugs subject to the steroid/cytochrome P4503A pathway predominated, genotypes in that pathway were important: vitamin D receptor (odds ratio [OR], 6.85 [95% confidence interval [CI], 1.73-27.0]) and cytochrome P4503A5 (OR, 4.61 [95% CI, 1.11-19.2]) polymorphisms were related to gastrointestinal toxicity and infection, respectively. During the consolidation phase, when antifolates predominated, the reduced folate carrier polymorphism predicted gastrointestinal toxicity (OR, 10.4 [95% CI, 1.35-80.4]) as it also did during continuation (OR, 2.01 [95% CI, 1.06-4.11]). In all 3 treatment phases, a glucuronosyltransferase polymorphism predicted hyperbilirubinemia (P = .017, P < .001, and P < .001) and methotrexate clearance (P = .028), which was also independently associated with hyperbilirubinemia (P = .026).

Contact with these chemicals is virtually unavoidable due to contamination of air, water, ground, food, beverages, and household items, as well as exposure to medicinals. The resulting adverse effects on reproduction are numerous. There is uncertainty regarding the mode of action of these chemicals, although various theories have been advanced, e.g., disruption of the central nervous system (CNS), DNA attack, enzyme inhibition, interference with hormonal action, and insult to membranes, proteins, and mitochondria. This review provides extensive evidence for involvement of oxidative stress (OS) and electron transfer (ET) as a unifying theme. Successful application of the mechanistic approach is made to all of the main classes of toxins, in addition to large numbers of miscellaneous types. We believe it is not coincidental that the vast majority of these substances incorporate ET functionalities (quinone, metal complex, ArNO2, or conjugated iminium) either per se or in metabolites, potentially giving rise to reactive oxygen species (ROS) by redox cycling. Some categories, e.g., peroxides and radiation, appear to generate ROS by non-ET routes. Other mechanisms are briefly addressed; a multifaceted approach to mode of action appears to be the most logical. Our framework should increase understanding and contribute to preventative measures, such as use of antioxidants.",17315244,"Mechanism of teratogenesis: electron transfer, reactive oxygen species, and antioxidants.",1,1
"The purpose of this study was to examine changes in the use of cytogenetic testing and identification of chromosomal abnormalities among pregnancies and children with birth defects. Utilizing data from 1968 to 2005 from the Metropolitan Atlanta Congenital Defects Program, we analyzed trends in the frequency and timing (prenatal or postnatal) of cytogenetic testing and the prevalence of recognized chromosome abnormalities among pregnancies and children with birth defects (n = 51,424). Cytogenetic testing of pregnancies and children with birth defects increased from 7.2% in 1968 to 25.0% in 2005, as did the identification of chromosomal abnormalities (2.2% in 1968 to 6.8% in 2005). The use of prenatal cytogenetic testing decreased from 1996 to 2005 among women aged ≥35 years. Identification of chromosomal abnormalities in pregnancies and children with birth defects increased from 1968 to 2005, possibly due to increased testing, improved diagnostic techniques, or increasing maternal age. The decline in prenatal cytogenetic testing observed among mothers aged ≥35 years may be related to the availability of improved prenatal screening techniques, resulting in a reduction in the utilization of invasive diagnostic tests.",22140020,"Trends in cytogenetic testing and identification of chromosomal abnormalities among pregnancies and children with birth defects, metropolitan Atlanta, 1968-2005.",0,0
"This study was designed to assess the association between pregnancy-related exposures to antibiotics recommended for use in the event of a bioterrorism attack and major congenital malformations. A retrospective cohort study included 30 049 infants from Tennessee Medicaid born between 1985 and 2000 identified from computerised state databases. Infants with fetal exposures to ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, doxycycline and amoxicillin (antibiotics recommended for potential bioterrorism attacks) (n = 24 521) and erythromycin (included as a positive control) (n = 2128) were compared with infants with no fetal exposure to any antibiotics (n = 3400). Major congenital malformations identified from computerised records were confirmed through medical record review. Overall, 869 (2.9%) of infants in the cohort had a confirmed major congenital malformation, with major malformations ranging from 2.5% to 3.0% among the antibiotic-specific exposure groups. No increased risk was present in multivariable analyses for any malformations and for malformations of specific organ systems. In conclusion, these data suggest that ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, doxycycline or amoxicillin use by pregnant women should not result in a greater incidence of overall major congenital malformations in infants whose mothers take these medications, though a large increase in risk cannot be ruled out.",19228311,Antibiotics potentially used in response to bioterrorism and the risk of major congenital malformations.,1,1

"In recent years, the preventability of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has gradually gained ground as an additional criterion for assessing drug-related risk, alongside seriousness, causality mechanism of action or frequency. However, the definition of preventability itself remains a concept that needs to be defined clearly so as to compare study results. After an overview of the current methods of measuring preventability, which include a French instrument, this work proposes a synthesis of the French studies assessing the preventability of ADRs over the last 30 years. Measuring preventability is important to classify ADRs as preventable/not preventable, but the ultimate aim remains to characterize these preventable ADRs, highlighting the clinical situations and drug classes related to the risk. It is then possible to provide targeted clinical actions to correct these situations and improve the clinical use of these drugs. Thus, assessing medical preventability should address the causes of ADRs and not the responsibility of healthcare professionals. Finally, certain ideas are proposed to improve the French scale and pursue its validation. ",27080838,Measuring the preventability of adverse drug reactions in France: A 2015 overview.,0,1
"<b>Objective:</b> To understand the levels of exposure to traffic-related air pollutants including nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)), PM(10) and PM(2.5), and the relationship between the exposure to air pollutants during pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy and birth defects. <b>Methods:</b> Data on air pollution and birth defects from 2013 to 2015 was collected. A case-crossover design was employed to analyze the exposure-response relationship between traffic-related air pollutants and birth defects. <b>Results:</b> A total of 4 235 pregnant women were studied. During the study period, the daily average concentrations of ambient NO(2), PM(10) and PM(2.5) appeared as 60.83 μg/m(3), 104.94 μg/m(3) and 103.88 μg/m(3), respectively, with the concentration of PM(2.5) larger than the 2(nd) version of Standard National Ambient Air Quality Standard. In addition, there were strong correlations seen between each of the pollutants (<i>P</i><0.01). After adjustment for the influence of meteorological factors, it was found that the exposure to high level of NO(2) and PM(10) during pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy increased the risk on birth defects (<i>P</i><0.05). <b>Conclusion:</b> Levels of exposure to adverse environmental factors during pre- pregnancy or early pregnancy could increase the risk of birth defects, suggesting that in these sensitive periods, women should try to avoid being exposed to high concentration of traffic-related air pollutants as NO(2), PM(10) <i>etc</i>. in order to reduce the risk of birth defects.",29294586,"[Relationship between exposure to air pollutants during pre-pregnancy or early pregnancy and birth defects in Xi'an, 2013-2015: a case crossover study].",0,0

"Cardiovascular toxicity is a prominent reason for failures in drug development, resulting in the demand for assays that can predict this liability in early drug discovery. We investigated whether iCell® cardiomyocytes have utility as an early QT/TdP screen. Thirty clinical drugs with known QT/TdP outcomes were evaluated blind using label-free microelectrode array (parameters measured were beating period (BP), field potential duration (FPD), fast Na<sup>+</sup> amplitude and slope) and live cell, fast kinetic fluorescent Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient FLIPR® Tetra (parameters measured were peak count, width, amplitude) systems. Many FPD-altering drugs also altered BP. Correction for BP, using a Log-Log (LL) model, was required to appropriately interpret direct drug effects on FPD. In comparison with human QT effects and when drug activity was to be predicted at top test concentration (TTC), LL-corrected FPD and peak count had poor assay sensitivity and specificity values: 13%/64% and 65%/11%, respectively. If effective free therapeutic plasma concentration (EFTPC) was used instead of TTC, the values were 0%/100% and 6%/100%, respectively. When compared to LL-corrected FPD and peak count, predictive values of uncorrected FPD, BP, width and amplitude were not much different. If pro-arrhythmic risk was to be predicted using Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient data, the values were 67%/100% and 78%/53% at EFTPC and TTC, respectively. Thus, iCell® cardiomyocytes have limited value as an integrated QT/TdP assay, highlighting the urgent need for improved experimental alternatives that may offer an accurate integrated cardiomyocyte safety model for supporting the development of new drugs without QT/TdP effects.",27622857,Assessment of extracellular field potential and Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient signals for early QT/pro-arrhythmia detection using human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes.,1,1
"Background Although medications play a vital role in the cure, palliation, and inhibition of disease, they also expose patients to drug-related problems (DRPs). DRPs are common in hospitalized patients. Specifically, pediatrics population are easily affected by DRPs, as dynamic and kinetic behaviors of drugs in this population are usually different than  in adults. Objectives To assess the prevalence of DRPs and associated factors in a pediatric setting in Ethiopia. Setting Pediatric ward of Zewditu Memorial Referral Hospital, Addis Abbeba, Ethiopia. Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted on 285 randomly selected patients. Data were obtained through review of physician medication orders and patient files. The prevalence and type of DRPs were studied and documented using the Pharmaceutical Care Network Europe Foundation classification system. The results were summarized using descriptive statistics including frequency, mean, and standard deviation. To identify the independent predicators of DRPs, logistic regression analysis was run and a P value ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. Main outcome measure DRPs, types of DRPs, drugs that are frequently involved in DRPs, and factors associated with DRPs. Main outcome measure Number of DRPs. Results Of the 1055 medication orders reviewed, a total of 106 DRPs were identified in 90 patients. This gives an overall rate of drug-related problems of 31.57%. The most frequently identified DRPs were dosing problems, with dose too low being 34.9% and dose too high being 7.5%. This was followed by drug-drug interactions (38.67%) and adverse drug reactions (8.49%). The number of prescribed drugs (AOR 2.3, 95% CI 1.3-4.3, P = 0.007) and total number of disease conditions (AOR 4.8, 95% CI 1.9, 12.1, P = 0.001) were potential risk factors for occurrence of DRPs. Conclusion The present study demonstrated that DRPs were common at the pediatric ward of Zewditu Memorial Referral Hospital and that it needs great attention. The most frequently identified DRPs were dosing problems, followed by drug-drug interactions and adverse drug reaction. Poly-pharmacy and number of disease conditions have been identified as important risk factors for occurrence of DRPs. The investigators recommend establishing a system for reporting DRPs in the pediatric ward of the hospital as it may facilitate appropriate measures for prospective interventions, such as training the healthcare team, as well as detail precautions to be followed by the practitioners. In addition to this, improving communication between the healthcare team members such as physicians, pharmacists, nurses, and other healthcare workers in the hospital is recommended.",28689305,"Assessment of drug-related problems in pediatric ward of Zewditu Memorial Referral Hospital, Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.",0,1
"The occurrence of mesenteric lymph node angiomas (benign vascular neoplasms including lymphangioma and hemangioma) in untreated control rats in 2-year carcinogenicity studies can range from rare to common depending on the strain used. This lesion is most common in male rats.

"This study found abnormalities in multiple reproductive stages in captive American kestrels (Falco sparverius) when exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) through dietary and in ovo exposure. American kestrels laid eggs with environmentally relevant total PCB levels (34.1 micrograms/g whole egg wet weight) when consuming PCB-spiked (Aroclor 1248:1254:1260) food (5-7 micrograms/g body weight per day) for 100 d only in 1998. In 1999, the same adults laid eggs with estimated total PCBs of 23 micrograms/g. Effects of maternal (only female exposed) and paternal (only male exposed) in ovo PCB exposure were investigated. Maternal F1 eggs contained predicted total PCB concentrations of 0.34 microgram/g. Specific abnormalities occurred more frequently during dietary F0 exposure, particularly aggressive courtship interactions, clutch abandonment, occurrences of cracked eggs, and developmental effects. Multiple developmental effects were more pronounced during than after dietary PCB exposure of adults, and although these effects were limited, nevertheless they occurred in the F1 maternal and F1 paternal pairs. However, the incidence of multiple deformities throughout the breeding season increased dramatically from 1998 (13%) to 1999 (56%) in F0 PCB-exposed pairs. Developmental abnormalities were unlikely to be attributed to the extrinsic factors of disease, genetics, or nutritional (vitamin D3) deficiencies, but rather to adverse changes in parental behavior and intrinsic factors involving altered genetic material and PCB exposure. Readily cleared PCB congeners may induce specific types of behavioral and developmental abnormalities, but persistent congeners and metabolites are likely producing (1) odd laying patterns, (2) odd laying patterns, (2) developmental effects including embryonic underdevelopment and edema, and (3) increased incidences of multiple deformities within a clutch.",14710594,"Reproductive abnormalities, teratogenicity, and developmental problems in American kestrels (Falco sparverius) exposed to polychlorinated biphenyls.",1,1

"Adverse pregnancy outcomes entail a large health burden for the mother and offspring; a part of it might be avoided by better understanding the role of environmental factors in their etiology.

For each outcome, we reviewed the possible study designs, main sources of bias, and their suggested cures. In terms of study design, for most pregnancy outcomes, cohorts with recruitment early during or even before pregnancy allow efficient characterization of pregnancy-related events, time-varying confounders, and in utero exposures that may impact birth outcomes and child health. Studies on congenital anomalies require specific designs, assessment of anomalies in medical pregnancy terminations, and, for congenital anomalies diagnosed postnatally, follow-up during several months after birth. Statistical analyses should take into account environmental exposures during the relevant time windows; survival models are an appropriate approach for fecundity, fetal loss, and gestational duration/preterm delivery. Analysis of gestational duration could distinguish pregnancies according to delivery induction (and possibly pregnancy-related conditions).

"Lymphatic filariasis has remained endemic in Fiji despite repeated mass drug administration using the well-established and safe combination of diethylcarbamazine and albendazole (DA) since 2002. In certain settings the addition of ivermectin to this combination (IDA) remains a safe strategy and is more efficacious. However, the safety has yet to be described in scabies and soil-transmitted helminth endemic settings like Fiji. Villages of Rotuma and Gau islands were randomised to either DA or IDA. Residents received weight-based treatment unblinded with standard exclusions. Participants were actively found and asked by a nurse about their health daily for the first two days and then asked to seek review for the next five days if unwell. Anyone with severe symptoms were reviewed by a doctor and any serious adverse event was reported to the Medical Monitor and Data Safety Monitoring Board. Of 3612 enrolled and eligible participants, 1216 were randomised to DA and 2396 to IDA. Age and sex in both groups were representative of the population. Over 99% (3598) of participants completed 7 days follow-up. Adverse events were reported by 600 participants (16.7%), distributed equally between treatment groups, with most graded as mild (93.2%). There were three serious adverse events, all judged not attributable to treatment by an independent medical monitor. Fatigue was the most common symptom reported by 8.5%, with headache, dizziness, nausea and arthralgia being the next four most common symptoms. Adverse events were more likely in participants with microfilaremia (43.2% versus 15.7%), but adverse event frequency was not related to the presence of scabies or soil-transmitted helminth infection. IDA has comparable safety to DA with the same frequency of adverse events experienced following community mass drug administration. The presence of co-endemic infections did not increase adverse events. IDA can be used in community programs where preventative chemotherapy is needed for control of lymphatic filariasis and other neglected tropical diseases.",32176703,"The safety of combined triple drug therapy with ivermectin, diethylcarbamazine and albendazole in the neglected tropical diseases co-endemic setting of Fiji: A cluster randomised trial.",0,1

"Extra-genital congenital anomalies are often present in cases of hypospadias, but it is unclear whether they have an association with the outcome of hypospadias surgery. The aim of this study was to review all hypospadias cases that had surgery between 2009 and 2015 at a single centre and identify clinical determinants of the surgical outcome. An extra-genital congenital anomaly was reported in 139 (22%) boys and 62 (10%) had more than 1 anomaly. Of the 626 boys, 54 (9%), including 44 with proximal hypospadias, had endocrine as well as limited genetic evaluation. Of these, 10 (19%) had a biochemical evidence of hypogonadism and 5 (9%) had a molecular genetic abnormality. At least 1 complication was reported in 167 (27%) patients, with 20% of complications (most frequently fistula) occurring after 2 years of surgery. The severity of hypospadias and the existence of other anomalies were clinical factors that were independently associated with an increased risk of complications (p < 0.001). In conclusion, complications following surgery are more likely in those cases that are proximal or who have additional extra-genital anomalies.

"Poisoning is the second leading cause of injury-related fatality in the USA and the leading cause of cardiac arrest in victims under 40 years of age. The study objective was to define the electrocardiographic (ECG) predictors of adverse cardiovascular events (ACVE) complicating suspected acute poisoning (SAP). This was a case-control study in adults at three tertiary-care hospitals and one regional Poison Control Center. We compared 34 cases of SAP complicated by ACVE to 101 consecutive control patients with uncomplicated SAP. The initial ECG was analyzed for rhythm, intervals, QT dispersion, ischemia, and infarction. ECGs were interpreted by a cardiologist, blinded to study hypothesis and case data. Subjects were 48% male, with mean age 42 +/- 19 years. In addition to clinical suspicion of poisoning in 100% of patients, routine toxicology screens were positive in 77%, most commonly for benzodiazepines, opioids, and/or acetaminophen. Neither the ventricular rate, the QRS duration, nor the presence of infarction predicted the risk of ACVE. However, the rhythm, QTc, QT dispersion, and presence of ischemia correlated with the risk of ACVE. Independent predictors of ACVE based on multivariable logistic regression were prolonged QTc, any non-sinus rhythm, ventricular ectopy, and ischemia. Recursive partitioning analysis identified very low risk criteria (94.1% sensitivity, 96.2% NPV) and high risk criteria (95% specificity). Among patients with SAP, the presence of QTc prolongation, QT dispersion, ventricular ectopy, any non-sinus rhythm, and evidence of ischemia on the initial ECG are strongly associated with ACVE.",20361362,Electrocardiographic predictors of adverse cardiovascular events in suspected poisoning.,1,1

A fetus with rare arteriovenous malformation of the vein of Galen, which represents less than 1% of all intracranial arteriovenous malformations, was monitored by intrapartum external cardiotocography in the 37 + 5 gestational week. The baby was born by cesarean section because of signs of imminent intrauterine hypoxia on cardiotocography. However, metabolic acidosis was not confirmed in umbilical cord blood sampling. Despite intensive neonatal care management, the newborn died 31 h after delivery because of progressive cardiac decompensation, hypotension and multi-organ failure.

"This study aimed to evaluate the prognosis of pulmonary sequestration (PS) by measuring congenital cystic adenomatoid malformation volume ratio (CVR) value in fetal congenital PS. The fetal CVR in 49 cases of fetal PS diagnosed by prenatal ultrasound in Xiangyang No. 1 People's Hospital from March 2010 to June 2017 were measured, and the clinical outcomes were observed. According to the prenatal ultrasound CVR value, 49 fetuses diagnosed with PS were divided into 2 groups: group 1 with CVR≥1.26, and group 2 with CVR<1.26. The incidence rate of fetal edema, respiratory distress symptoms and survival rate were compared between the two groups. The risk factors of the fetal PS were evaluated by single and multiple Logistic regression analysis. The correlation between CVR and fetal prognosis was analyzed. Of the 49 fetuses, there were 34 cases of PS (ILS) type (69.39%, 34/49), 10 cases of PS (ELS) type I (20.41%, 10/49) and 5 cases of PS (ELS) type II (10.20%, 5/49). Forty-six cases (93.88%, 46/49) were born alive, there was 1 case (CVR ≥1.26) (2.04%, 1/49) of induced abortion, and 2 cases (CVR ≥1.26) (4.08%, 2/49) of stillbirths. In group 1 (n=24), 21 cases were born alive, and the incidence rate of newborn respiratory distress and fetal edema was 100% (21/21) and 79.17% (19/24) respectively. In group 2 (n=25), there were 3 cases (12%,3/25) of newborn respiratory distress, 3 cases (12%, 3/25) of fetal edema, and the rate of live birth was 100%. There were statistically significant differences between the two groups in the incidence of fetal edema, postpartum respiratory symptoms and survival rate. CVR was a risk factor for PS and was associated with fetal prognosis. CVR in the midtrimester of pregnancy is an effective index to evaluate the prognosis of fetal PS.

"The poor correlation of developmental toxicity studies in animals with human outcome data has emphasized the need for complementary assays based on human cells and tissues. As neural tube defects represent an important proportion of congenital malformations, we evaluated here the accuracy of a human embryonic stem cell (hESC)-based assay to predict chemically induced disruption of neural tube formation. As teratogenic compounds, we used cyclopamine (CPA), valproic acid (VPA), ochratoxin A (OTA) and mycophenolic acid (MMF), all suspected or known inducers of human neural tube defects, as well as theophylline and saccharin as negative control compounds. We analyzed their effects on the ability of hES cells to give rise to neural precursors (expressing specific marker Nestin), to form neural tube-like structures (rosettes), and to express specific markers (Sox1, Otx2, Lix1, EvI1, Rspo3) during rosette formation. The results showed that various effects of the selected compounds on early neural development could be specifically revealed in vitro through related alterations of neurogenic differentiation of hESC. Furthermore, it was possible to discriminate toxicants acting at different time points during embryonic development and, therefore, responsible for distinct adverse effects on neural tube formation. By comparing four different hESC lines, we observed a significant (up to fivefold) variability of the line-dependent response to toxicants. We highlight at least two sources of variability: one related to the heterogeneity of hESC lines in culture (stemness/commitment profiles); the second to possible genetically determined differences in individual sensitivity to teratogens.",31401662,"Accuracy, discriminative properties and reliability of a human ESC-based in vitro toxicity assay to distinguish teratogens responsible for neural tube defects.",1,1

"Renal agenesis and hypodysplasia (RHD) are major causes of pediatric chronic kidney disease and are highly genetically heterogeneous. We conducted whole-exome sequencing in 202 case subjects with RHD and identified diagnostic mutations in genes known to be associated with RHD in 7/202 case subjects. In an additional affected individual with RHD and a congenital heart defect, we found a homozygous loss-of-function (LOF) variant in SLIT3, recapitulating phenotypes reported with Slit3 inactivation in the mouse. To identify genes associated with RHD, we performed an exome-wide association study with 195 unresolved case subjects and 6,905 control subjects. The top signal resided in GREB1L, a gene implicated previously in Hoxb1 and Shha signaling in zebrafish.

"Large outbreaks of acute food-related poisoning, characterized by hepatic sinusoidal obstruction syndrome, hemorrhagic necrosis, and rapid liver failure, occur on a regular basis in some countries. They are caused by 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids contaminating locally grown grain. Similar acute poisoning can also result from deliberate or accidental consumption of 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloid-containing herbal medicines, teas, and spices. In recent years, it has been confirmed that there is also significant, low-level dietary exposure to 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids in many countries due to consumption of common foods such as honey, milk, eggs, salads, and meat. The level of 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids in these foods is generally too low and too intermittent to cause acute toxicity. However, these alkaloids are genotoxic and can cause slowly developing chronic diseases such as pulmonary arterial hypertension, cancers, cirrhosis, and congenital anomalies, conditions unlikely to be easily linked with dietary exposure to 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids, especially if clinicians are unaware that such dietary exposure is occurring. This Perspective provides a comprehensive review of the acute and chronic toxicity of 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids and their potential to initiate certain chronic diseases, and suggests some associative considerations or indicators to assist in recognizing specific cases of diseases that may have resulted from dietary exposure to these hazardous natural substances. If it can be established that low-level dietary exposure to 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine alkaloids is a significant cause of some of these costly and debilitating diseases, then this should lead to initiatives to reduce the level of these alkaloids in the food chain.",25483859,"Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids: Potential Role in the Etiology of Cancers, Pulmonary Hypertension, Congenital Anomalies, and Liver Disease.",1,1

"Aldehyde oxidase contributes to drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics (PK), and a few clinical studies were discontinued because of aldehyde oxidase metabolism. Its AOX1, AOX3, AOX3L1, and AOX4 isoforms are expressed in mammals, and species differences in expression profiles reflect differences in drug metabolism and PK between animals and humans. Individual differences in aldehyde oxidase activity also influence drug metabolism in humans. Moreover, the reduced solubility of the aldehyde oxidase metabolites may induce drug toxicity. Because various drugs inhibit aldehyde oxidase, assessments of ensuing drug-drug interactions (DDI) are critical for drug optimization. Although drug metabolism, PK, safety, and DDI are important, drugs such as famciclovir and O6-benzylguanine that affect aldehyde oxidase activity in humans have been reported. Recently, various in vitro approaches have been developed to predict PK in humans. However, in vitro studies on aldehyde oxidase may be hampered because of its instability. In contrast, in vivo studies on chimeric mice with humanized livers have also been focused on to predict aldehyde oxidase-mediated metabolism. Additionally, the ratios of N1-methylnicotinamide to metabolites in urinary excretions may represent useful biomarkers of aldehyde oxidase activity in humans.

"Development of fetal kidney is a finely programmed sequence, and is regulated by many important molecules.

"Pharmacovigilance is a practice aimed to monitor drug safety in real life conditions and capture adverse drug events during the post marketing phase of drug's life cycle. But under reporting of adverse reactions is a major cause of concern and a threat to the pharmacovigilance systems. The present article looks into the major obstacles affecting the spontaneous reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in India and the possible solutions. As per available scientific literature, the major impediments to ADR reporting are inadequate knowledge and awareness among health professionals, clinicians' perceptions towards reporting, problems with establishing reporting systems in hospitals and insufficient training to recognize ADRs. Measures to improve the situation include greater involvement of nurses, pharmacists as well as consumers in the reporting of ADRs, making the process simpler and faster through electronic means, introducing educational interventions and training programs for health care providers and spreading awareness about the reporting system amongst caregivers and receivers alike. Providing a momentum to the pharmacovigilance system and ensuring a robust reporting process is a challenge but proper planning, feasible solutions and focussed efforts can help bring about the change ensuring patient safety - the ultimate goal of pharmacovigilance.",30175985,"Reporting of adverse drug reactions in India: A review of the current scenario, obstacles and possible solutions.",0,1

"In the past few decades, great conceptual and technological advances have been made in the field of toxicology, but animal model-based research still remains one of the most widely used and readily available tools for furthering our current knowledge. However, animal models are not perfect in predicting all systemic toxicity in humans. Extrapolating animal data to accurately predict human toxicities remains a challenge, and researchers are obligated to question the appropriateness of their chosen animal model. This paper provides an assessment of the utility of the methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet fed animal model in reflecting human nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the potential risks of adverse drug reactions and toxicities that are associated with the disease. As a commonly used NASH model, the MCD model fails to exhibit most metabolic abnormalities in a similar manner to the human disease. The MCD model, on the other hand, closely resembles human NASH histology and reflects signatures of drug transporter alterations in humans. Due to the nature of the MCD model, it should be avoided in studies of NASH pathogenesis, metabolic parameter evaluation, and biomarker identification. But it can be used to accurately predict altered drug disposition due to NASH-associated transporter alterations.",29145614,Asking the Right Questions With Animal Models: Methionine- and Choline-Deficient Model in Predicting Adverse Drug Reactions in Human NASH.,0,1

"Citrate esters have been considered as alternatives to phthalate plasticizers. Being considered to have low toxicity in mammals, their toxicological information for aquatic animals remains poorly understood. We examined the developmental toxicity of citrate esters including tributyl O-acetylcitrate (ATBC), triethyl 2-acetylcitrate (ATEC), and trihexyl O-acetylcitrate (ATHC) together with dibutyl phthalate (DBP) based on the frog embryo teratogenesis assay-Xenopus (FETAX). ATBC has the lowest 96 h LC<sub>50</sub> and 96 h EC<sub>50</sub> values. In RT-qPCR, the ratio of bax and bcl-2 mRNA was significantly increased by DBP, but not by ATBC, ATEC and ATHC. DNA fragmentation was obvious in DBP-treated tadpoles, but not in those treated with ATBC and ATEC, whereas ATHC caused necrotic DNA degradation. Lipid hydroperoxide levels in tadpoles were significantly increased by DBP and ATHC, but not by ATBC and ATEC, suggesting that induction of oxidative stress by DBP and ATHC in embryos. In tadpoles with head abnormalities, basihyal bone, ceratohyal bone and Meckel's cartilage were frequently missed together with reduction in branchial gill bones. Col2a1 mRNA in the head of tadpoles was significantly decreased by low concentration of DBP, ATHC, and high concentration of ATEC. In stage 25 embryos FoxN3 mRNA, a master regulator for differentiation of neural crest cells to chondrocytes in head, was significantly decreased by DBP and ATHC, but not by ATBC and ATEC.

"<b>Objective:</b> To explore the clinical characteristics of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) in children and to study the effectiveness of second-line anti-TB therapy for children and to examine the incidence of adverse drug reactions. <b>Method:</b> Retrospective research was conducted. The clinical records of children in West China Second Hospital diagnosed as drug-resistant TB from January 2010 to June 2014 were investigated.The clinical characteristics and risk factors were analyzed retrospectively. Treatment effect at discharge was examined as a short-term outcome indicator to evaluate the effectiveness of second-line anti-TB therapy and the incidence of adverse drug reactions. χ(2) test was used. <b>Result:</b> Forty-six patients were diagnosed as drug-resistant TB in 443 children infected with TB, with a 10.4% resistance rate. The 46 children included 26 male and 20 female patients, aged from one month and 28 days to 17 years and 5 months, with the average age (8.4±4.5) years, >7 to 14 years old patients as the biggest part(25 patients, 54.3%).

"Catamnestic investigations on the course of pregnancy, family history and genetics were carried out in 141 children suffering from congenital hydrocephalus. The results were compared with those obtained from a group of non-malformed controls investigated by the same criteria. There was a considerably higher incidence of pregnancy disturbances (i.e. diseases, drugs, haemorrhage etc.) in mothers who later gave birth to a child with congenital hydrocephalus, than mothers of the control group (congenital hydrocephalus: 61.3% vs. controls: 30.1%). This high incidence of pregnancy disturbances could be particularly referred to a sevenfold increased rate of diseases and a fourfold increased rate of drug intake during the first trimester. There was also a higher rate of malformed relatives in children with congenital hydrocephalus (16.7%) than in controls (6.4%); not only were malformations of the central nervous system found to be increased but also malformations of other organ systems in relatives. This is interpreted as a hint not only at genetic influences but also at a generally higher incidence of malformations in a relatively small group of persons. Calculated figures of recurrence risk were in accordance with empirical data used in genetic counselling.",2375184,Catamnestic investigations in children with congenital hydrocephalus.,1,1
"The incidence of obesity in pregnancy has increased over the past 2 decades, with nearly 50% of U.S. women aged 15-49 years classified as overweight or obese. Obesity (independent of diabetes) among gravidae poses unique risks that extend toward the fetus, with several large population-based analyses demonstrating independent increased risks for fetal malformations including neural tube defects, cardiac anomalies, and orofacial clefts, as well as stillbirth and macrosomia. Unfortunately, several lines of evidence also suggest that the quality of the prenatal fetal anatomic survey and certain aspects of prenatal diagnostic screening programs are significantly limited. The net effect is that among obese gravidae, the increased risk of fetal anomalies is further offset by a concomitant diminished ability to sonographically detect such malformations in the prenatal interval. The purpose of this summary review is to systematically examine the evidence suggesting an increased risk of fetal malformations in obese gravidae, the contributing role of diabetes, and the limitations of prenatal diagnostic and sonographic screening among this at-risk population.",22713503,Obesity and the risk and detection of fetal malformations.,0,0
"Clozapine is a second-generation antipsychotic which has proven efficacy in treating the symptoms of schizophrenia. Although clozapine therapy is associated with a number of adverse drug reactions, it is frequently used. One of the most common adverse drug reactions is gastroesophageal reflux disease which is an indication for treatment with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). Coadministration of clozapine and PPIs increases the risk of hematological adverse drug reactions, including neutropenia and agranulocytosis. The mechanism in idiosyncratic agranulocytosis is not dose related and involves either a direct toxic or an immune-allergic effect. It is suspected that the clozapine metabolites nitrenium ion and N-desmethylclozapine may cause apoptosis or impair growth of granulocytes. Formation of N-desmethylclozapine is correlated with activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes 1A2 and 3A4 (CYP1A2 and CYP3A4). Nitrenium ion is produced by the flavin-containing monooxygenase system of leukocytes. A drug interaction between clozapine and a PPI is a consequence of the induction of common metabolic pathways either by the PPI or clozapine. Findings to date suggest that indirect induction of flavin-containing monooxygenase by omeprazole through the aryl hydrocarbon receptor increases the expression of the enzyme mRNA and in the long term may cause the increase in activity. Moreover, induction of CYP1A2, especially by omeprazole and lansoprazole, may increase the serum concentration of N-desmethylclozapine, which can accumulate in lymphocytes and may achieve toxic levels. Another hypothesis that may explain hematological adverse drug reactions is competitive inhibition of CYP2C19, which may contribute to increased serum concentrations of toxic metabolites.",28291036,Potential Mechanisms of Hematological Adverse Drug Reactions in Patients Receiving Clozapine in Combination With Proton Pump Inhibitors.,0,1

"See Meschia (doi:10.1093/brain/awy066) for a scientific commentary on this article.Vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation is a congenital anomaly of the cerebral vasculature representing 30% of all paediatric vascular malformations. We conducted whole exome sequencing in 19 unrelated patients presenting this malformation and subsequently screened candidate genes in a cohort of 32 additional patients using either targeted exome or Sanger sequencing. In a cohort of 51 patients, we found five affected individuals with heterozygous mutations in EPHB4 including de novo frameshift (p.His191Alafs*32) or inherited deleterious splice or missense mutations predicted to be pathogenic by in silico tools. Knockdown of ephb4 in zebrafish embryos leads to specific anomalies of dorsal cranial vessels including the dorsal longitudinal vein, which is the orthologue of the median prosencephalic vein and the embryonic precursor of the vein of Galen. This model allowed us to investigate EPHB4 loss-of-function mutations in this disease by the ability to rescue the brain vascular defect in knockdown zebrafish co-injected with wild-type, but not truncated EPHB4, mimicking the p.His191Alafs mutation. Our data showed that in both species, loss of function mutations of EPHB4 result in specific and similar brain vascular development anomalies. Recently, EPHB4 germline mutations have been reported in non-immune hydrops fetalis and in cutaneous capillary malformation-arteriovenous malformation. Here, we show that EPHB4 mutations are also responsible for vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation, indicating that heterozygous germline mutations of EPHB4 result in a large clinical spectrum. The identification of EPHB4 pathogenic mutations in patients presenting capillary malformation or vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation should lead to careful follow-up of pregnancy of carriers for early detection of anomaly of the cerebral vasculature in order to propose optimal neonatal care. Endovascular embolization indeed greatly improved the prognosis of patients.",29444212,Loss of function mutations in EPHB4 are responsible for vein of Galen aneurysmal malformation.,1,0
"Corticosteroid-related adverse events (AEs) are commonly reported in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), but are often under-represented in claims data. The most common corticosteroid-related AEs are not necessarily the most costly. The present study aimed to examine corticosteroid-related AE rates and identify the associated cost consequences in patients with SLE from the perspective of rheumatologists treating SLE in the United States (US). A modified Delphi process and RAND Appropriateness Method was used to estimate corticosteroid-related AEs and costs based on data from SLE-treating US rheumatologists and estimates from alternative sources. The panel (n=10) participated in two web-based questionnaires, covering disease severity, corticosteroid use, corticosteroid-related AEs, and resource utilization associated with treatment of the AEs. Eight members of the panel then participated in a guided discussion by interactive teleconference, in which the costs associated with specific corticosteroid-related AEs were also discussed. Consensus was achieved in the teleconference when a single response category (consensus values from 1 to 4 [4=strongly agree, 1=strongly disagree]) accounted for ≥80% of responses. Thirteen consensus statements were developed following two Delphi rounds. Costs were estimated for eight corticosteroid-associated AEs from the panel of rheumatologists. In the patients with SLE treated by these physicians, 41.5% were considered to have mild disease, 36.5% moderate disease, and 22.0% severe disease. The number of specialist visits, corticosteroid use, and corticosteroid dose increased with disease severity. The estimated rates of all AEs (except for cataracts) were at least doubled in patients receiving corticosteroid doses>20 mg/day compared with ≤20 mg/day. The highest estimated mean total costs of an event (for the required treatment duration for one patient) were for avascular necrosis ($14,460) and serious infection ($11,660). The costs of more common AEs, such as osteoporosis, obesity, diabetes, and fractures, ranged from $1190 to $8220. Ten rheumatologists concluded that as disease severity increases, corticosteroid doses increased.

"Congenital skeletal abnormalities may be genetic, teratogenic, or nutritional in origin; distinguishing among these different causes is essential in the management of the disease but may be challenging. In some cases, teratogenic or nutritional causes of skeletal abnormalities may appear very similar to genetic causes. For example, chondrodysplasia associated with intrauterine zinc or manganese deficiency and mild forms of hereditary chondrodysplasia have very similar clinical features and histologic lesions. Therefore, historical data are essential in any attempt to distinguish genetic and acquired causes of skeletal lesions; as many animals as possible should be examined; and samples should be collected for future analysis, such as genetic testing. Acquired causes of defects often show substantial variation in presentation and may improve with time, while genetic causes frequently have a consistent presentation. If a disease is determined to be of genetic origin, a number of approaches may be used to detect mutations, each with advantages and disadvantages. These approaches include sequencing candidate genes, single-nucleotide polymorphism array with genomewide association studies, and exome or whole genome sequencing.

The risks of congenital heart defects, malformations of the nervous system, and limb defects also progressively increased with BMI from overweight to obesity class III. The largest organ specific relative risks related to maternal overweight and increasing obesity were observed for malformations of the nervous system. Malformations of the genital and digestive systems were also increased in offspring of obese mothers.<b>Conclusions</b> Risks of any major congenital malformation and several subgroups of organ specific malformations progressively increased with maternal overweight and increasing severity of obesity. For women who are planning pregnancy, efforts should be encouraged to reduce adiposity in those with a BMI above the normal range.",28615173,Risk of major congenital malformations in relation to maternal overweight and obesity severity: cohort study of 1.2 million singletons.,1,0

"Pregnant women routinely undergo prenatal screening in Australia and this has become a common experience of motherhood. When prenatal screening or prenatal testing results in diagnosis of a serious fetal abnormality, women are presented with a decision to continue or terminate their pregnancy. Few recent studies have explored women's psychosocial experience of prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality, and within this small group of studies it is rare for research to consider the embodied aspect of women's experiences. This paper reports on qualitative findings from in-depth interviews with 59 women in Melbourne, Australia who received a prenatal diagnosis of a significant abnormality and decided to terminate the pregnancy. Interview transcripts were coded inductively through thematic analysis. Two themes about embodiment were generated from the interviews: transitioning embodiment, and vulnerable bodies in un/comfortable spaces. Theory of pregnant embodiment was drawn on in interpreting women's narratives. Recommendations arising from the analysis include health professionals recognising, acknowledging and accommodating the transitioning embodied state of women as they consider, prepare for, undergo and recover from pregnancy termination for fetal abnormality. Further recommendations address the connections and disconnections between this transitioning embodied state and the spaces of clinics, hospitals and home.

"Although the thalidomide tragedy occurred more than 50 years ago, the medication is still being used worldwide for different reasons, and several aspects regarding its teratogenicity remain unsolved. Despite the strict regulation implemented, new cases of thalidomide embryopathy (TE) are still being registered in Brazil. Furthermore, the molecular processes that lead to malformations when the embryo is exposed to thalidomide have not yet been fully identified. In this article, we perform a critical analysis of thalidomide's history in Brazil, highlighting aspects of the occurrence of TE over the decades. Finally, we present the main perspectives and challenges for ongoing surveillance and prevention of TE in Brazil. The effective control of dispensing thalidomide, especially in areas where leprosy is endemic, is one of the most important and challenging points. Furthermore, the emergence of thalidomide analogues is fast approaching, and their availability would pose additional concerns. The understanding of the molecular mechanisms and targets of thalidomide in both experimental and human models is essential for generating new insights into teratogenic mechanisms, so that safer thalidomide analogues can be developed.",27638330,The impact of thalidomide use in birth defects in Brazil.,0,0
"A 2 mo old golden retriever presented with malformation of the left thoracic limb and a small circular indentation of the skin in the cranial thoracic spine. Radiographs showed a cleft between the second and fifth metacarpal bones of the left thoracic limb compatible with ectrodactyly and spina bifida affecting T4 and T5 vertebrae. Magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracic spine showed dorsal reposition of the spinal cord and a tract connecting from the dura mater to the skin. No other malformations were detected. Surgical excision of the tract was performed and histopathological examination diagnosed a dermoid sinus type IV. Dermoid sinus and spina bifida are well-recognized congenital spinal and spinal cord defects, yet association with other congenital malformation are rarely reported in dogs. The here-reported dog had spinal and spinal cord abnormalities with concurrent limb malformation, which are two components of a nonrandom association of birth defects described as VACTERL in people. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report describing concurrent dermoid sinus type IV, spina bifida, and ectrodactyly in a dog, and highlights the importance of patient examination for occurrence of multiple malformations to provide an appropriate prognosis for an owner.",29131674,Congenital Malformations Resembling VACTERL Association in a Golden Retriever.,1,0

"The paper presents a summary of the literature published until December 2000 on effects from some industrial chemical exposures on color perception, as well as short descriptions of the tests applied. Several different tests have been used to study acquired alterations of color vision. These changes are frequently found in the blue-yellow axis. Many of the tests were originally designed to detect congenital alterations in the red-green axis, and thus have relatively low sensitivity when studying chemically induced deficits in color perception. At present, the Lanthony D15-desaturated panel seems most suitable for application in industrial settings, since it is clearly the most sensitive and easily administered test. Color vision seems to be a physiological function very sensitive to several chemicals. The potency of industrial chemicals to induce color vision deficiencies has often been investigated during the last two decades. The chemicals most frequently studied are different solvents and mercury. Pronounced effects on color perception have been reported following chronic exposure to organic solvents such as styrene, carbon disulphide, perchloroethylene, n-hexane and solvent mixtures, and to organic as well as inorganic mercury. The effect of occupational toluene exposure seems not as well established, since only slight effects and several negative studies have been reported. For some of these compounds the effect on color vision has been further established through the finding of clear dose-effect relationships. In a few cases, even acute exposure situations, e.g. exposure to toluene for a few hours or acute alcohol intake, seem to affect color perception. Follow-up studies are needed to investigate the possible reversibility of effects in relation to discontinued or reduced exposures.",12520762,Color vision and occupational chemical exposures: I.

"Environmental contamination by trinitrotoluene is of global concern due to its widespread use in military ordnance and commercial explosives. Despite known long-term persistence in groundwater and soil, the toxicological profile of trinitrotoluene and other explosive wastes have not been systematically measured using in vivo biological assays. Zebrafish embryos are ideal model vertebrates for high-throughput toxicity screening and live in vivo imaging due to their small size and transparency during embryogenesis. Here, we used Single Plane Illumination Microscopy (SPIM)/light sheet microscopy to assess the developmental toxicity of explosive-contaminated water in zebrafish embryos and report 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene-associated developmental abnormalities, including defects in heart formation and circulation, in 3D. Levels of apoptotic cell death were higher in the actively developing tissues of trinitrotoluene-treated embryos than controls. Live 3D imaging of heart tube development at cellular resolution by light-sheet microscopy revealed trinitrotoluene-associated cardiac toxicity, including hypoplastic heart chamber formation and cardiac looping defects, while the real time PCR (polymerase chain reaction) quantitatively measured the molecular changes in the heart and blood development supporting the developmental defects at the molecular level. Identification of cellular toxicity in zebrafish using the state-of-the-art 3D imaging system could form the basis of a sensitive biosensor for environmental contaminants and be further valued by combining it with molecular analysis.",27869673,"3D Visualization of Developmental Toxicity of 2,4,6-Trinitrotoluene in Zebrafish Embryogenesis Using Light-Sheet Microscopy.",1,1

"Contemporary preclinical in vitro and in vivo methods have been imperfect in predicting drug-induced Torsades de Pointes (TdP) in humans. A better understanding of additional relevant factors in the genesis of drug-induced TdP is necessary. New sophisticated in vitro techniques, such as arterially perfused ventricular wedge preparations or isolated perfused hearts, potentially offer a better understanding of torsadogenic mechanisms and a refinement of drug testing. Of particular interest are the dispersion of repolarization and the refractoriness of different cell types across the ventricular wall, triangulation of the action potential, reverse use dependence and instability of the action potential duration. In vivo models are currently refined by establishing parameters such as beat-to-beat variability and T-wave morphology as derived from the in vitro proarrhythmia indices. Animal models of proarrhythmia are to date not recommended for routine evaluation. A pharmacodynamic interaction with combinations of torsadogenic compounds is another area to be considered. Little is known about channel/receptor cross talk, although considerable evidence exists that cardiac G protein-coupled receptors can modulate hERG channel function. More investigations are necessary to further evaluate the role of altered gene expression, mutations, and polymorphisms in drug-induced TdP. A novel mechanism of drug-induced torsadogenesis is the reduced expression of hERG channel protein on the plasma membrane due to a trafficking defect. Pharmacokinetic and metabolism data are crucial for calculating the risk of a torsadogenic potential in man. Consideration of intracardiac accumulation can help in delineating pharmacokinetic-pharmacodyamic relationships. In silico virtual screening procedures with new chemical entities to predict hERG block may develop as a promising tool. The role of in silico modeling of TdP arrhythmia is likely to become increasingly important for organizing and integrating the vast amount of generated data.

"Background Congenital heart diseases (CHDs) are abnormalities that present in the heart since birth and are one of the leading causes of infant mortality in the world. CHDs are more common among children with dysmorphic syndromes. The current study aims to estimate the prevalence of many CHDs in different dysmorphic syndromes. Methods This was a retrospective chart review study conducted on all dysmorphic syndrome patients who attended genetic clinics at King Khalid National Guard Hospital in King Abdulaziz Medical City (KAMC), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia from 2005 to 2016. Dysmorphic pediatric patients less than 14 years old who had genetic testing to confirm their diagnosis were included in the study. Patients who did not have any previous echocardiography were excluded. Results A total of 212 individuals (47% males and 53% females) were included. Eighty-five percent of Down syndrome patients had CHDs, and the most common CHD was an atrial septal defect (ASD) (51%). In patients with Turner syndrome, 45% of them had CHDs, and bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) (40%) was the most common defect. In DiGeorge syndrome, 81% of patients had CHDs, and ventricular septal defect (VSD) (41%) was the most common. In Williams syndrome, 83% of patients had CHDs. All patients with Noonan, Edwards, CHARGE (coloboma, heart defects, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia), growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities), and Rubinstein-Taybi syndromes were found to have CHDs. In Patau syndrome and Joubert syndrome, 50% of patients in each had CHDs. Patients with Prader Willi syndrome had normal findings in the echocardiogram. Conclusion The highest prevalence of CHDs was found in Down syndrome. This study has a significant impact on the future of managing and directing the resources to improve the quality of life for syndromic patients. Further studies are needed to confirm these findings and to increase the local data in the field of CHDs in Saudi Arabia among syndromic patients.",32489745,The Prevalence of Congenital Heart Diseases in Syndromic Children at King Khalid National Guard Hospital from 2005 to 2016.,1,0

"A risk analysis of in utero caffeine exposure is presented utilizing epidemiological studies and animal studies dealing with congenital malformation, pregnancy loss, and weight reduction. These effects are of interest to teratologists, because animal studies are useful in their evaluation. Many of the epidemiology studies did not evaluate the impact of the ""pregnancy signal,"" which identifies healthy pregnancies and permits investigators to identify subjects with low pregnancy risks. The spontaneous abortion epidemiology studies were inconsistent and the majority did not consider the confounding introduced by not considering the pregnancy signal. The animal studies do not support the concept that caffeine is an abortafacient for the wide range of human caffeine exposures. Almost all the congenital malformation epidemiology studies were negative. Animal pharmacokinetic studies indicate that the teratogenic plasma level of caffeine has to reach or exceed 60 µg/ml, which is not attainable from ingesting large amounts of caffeine in foods and beverages. No epidemiological study described the ""caffeine teratogenic syndrome."" Six of the 17 recent epidemiology studies dealing with the risk of caffeine and fetal weight reduction were negative. Seven of the positive studies had growth reductions that were clinically insignificant and none of the studies cited the animal literature. Analysis of caffeine's reproductive toxicity considers reproducibility and plausibility of clinical, epidemiological, and animal data. Moderate or even high amounts of beverages and foods containing caffeine do not increase the risks of congenital malformations, miscarriage or growth retardation. Pharmacokinetic studies markedly improve the ability to perform the risk analyses.",21370398,Evaluation of the reproductive and developmental risks of caffeine.,1,1
"Measuring toxicity is an important step in drug development. Nevertheless, the current experimental methods used to estimate the drug toxicity are expensive and time-consuming, indicating that they are not suitable for large-scale evaluation of drug toxicity in the early stage of drug development. Hence, there is a high demand to develop computational models that can predict the drug toxicity risks. In this study, we used a dataset that consists of 553 drugs that biotransformed in liver. The toxic effects were calculated for the current data, namely, mutagenic, tumorigenic, irritant and reproductive effect. Each drug is represented by 31 chemical descriptors (features). The proposed model consists of three phases. In the first phase, the most discriminative subset of features is selected using rough set-based methods to reduce the classification time while improving the classification performance. In the second phase, different sampling methods such as Random Under-Sampling, Random Over-Sampling and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), BorderLine SMOTE and Safe Level SMOTE are used to solve the problem of imbalanced dataset. In the third phase, the Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier is used to classify an unknown drug into toxic or non-toxic. SVM parameters such as the penalty parameter and kernel parameter have a great impact on the classification accuracy of the model. In this paper, Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) has been proposed to optimize the parameters of SVM, so that the classification error can be reduced. The experimental results proved that the proposed model achieved high sensitivity to all toxic effects. Overall, the high sensitivity of the WOA+SVM model indicates that it could be used for the prediction of drug toxicity in the early stage of drug development.",28286029,Classification of toxicity effects of biotransformed hepatic drugs using whale optimized support vector machines.,0,0
"Unwanted side effects of drugs are a burden on patients and a severe impediment in the development of new drugs. At the same time, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) recorded during clinical trials are an important source of human phenotypic data. It is therefore essential to combine data on drugs, targets and side effects into a more complete picture of the therapeutic mechanism of actions of drugs and the ways in which they cause adverse reactions. To this end, we have created the SIDER ('Side Effect Resource', http://sideeffects.embl.de) database of drugs and ADRs. The current release, SIDER 4, contains data on 1430 drugs, 5880 ADRs and 140 064 drug-ADR pairs, which is an increase of 40% compared to the previous version. For more fine-grained analyses, we extracted the frequency with which side effects occur from the package inserts. This information is available for 39% of drug-ADR pairs, 19% of which can be compared to the frequency under placebo treatment. SIDER furthermore contains a data set of drug indications, extracted from the package inserts using Natural Language Processing. These drug indications are used to reduce the rate of false positives by identifying medical terms that do not correspond to ADRs. ",26481350,The SIDER database of drugs and side effects.,0,1

"This work focuses on the detection of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in electronic health records (EHRs) written in Spanish. The World Health Organization underlines the importance of reporting ADRs for patients' safety. The fact is that ADRs tend to be under-reported in daily hospital praxis. In this context, automatic solutions based on text mining can help to alleviate the workload of experts. Nevertheless, these solutions pose two challenges: 1) EHRs show high lexical variability, the characterization of the events must be able to deal with unseen words or contexts and 2) ADRs are rare events, hence, the system should be robust against skewed class distribution. To tackle these challenges, deep neural networks seem appropriate because they allow a high-level representation. Specifically, we opted for a joint AB-LSTM network, a sub-class of the bidirectional long short-term memory network. Besides, in an attempt to reinforce lexical variability, we proposed the use of embeddings created using lemmas. We compared this approach with supervised event extraction approaches based on either symbolic or dense representations.

"A skeleton with a number of abnormalities is described involving full discussion of alternative diagnoses. In this complex case, the primary diagnosis is of avulsion of the stem of the bifurcate ligament causing a fracture of the anterior process of the calcaneus.

There is also a separate anatomical variation of the feet, 3rd cuneiform and 3rd metatarsal coalition, which was not the cause of trauma. The bifurcate ligament is a major stabilizer of the lateral transverse talar joint, and the trauma could lead to further issues: however, multiple other traumatic changes in 3A-7 most likely occurred at the same time, rather than as the result of pre-existing foot trauma.

"Lorlatinib is a novel, highly potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation ALK/ROS1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), which has broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with crizotinib and second-generation ALK TKIs. The safety profile of lorlatinib was established based on 295 patients who had received the recommended dose of lorlatinib 100 mg once daily. Adverse events associated with lorlatinib are primarily mild to moderate in severity, with hypercholesterolemia (82.4%), hypertriglyceridemia (60.7%), edema (51.2%), peripheral neuropathy (43.7%), and central nervous system effects (39.7%) among the most frequently reported. These can be effectively managed with dose modification and/or standard supportive medical therapy, as indicated by a low incidence of permanent discontinuations due to adverse reactions. Most patients (81.0%) received at least one lipid-lowering agent. Prescription of supportive therapy should also consider the potential for drug-drug interactions with lorlatinib via engagement of specific CYP450 enzymes. This article summarizes the clinical experience from lorlatinib phase I investigators and was generated from discussion and review of the clinical study protocol and database to provide an expert consensus opinion on the management of the key adverse reactions reported with lorlatinib, including hyperlipidemia, central nervous system effects, weight increase, edema, peripheral neuropathy, and gastrointestinal effects. Overall, lorlatinib 100 mg once daily has a unique safety profile to be considered when prescribed, based on the recent U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive metastatic non-small cell lung cancer previously treated with a second-generation ALK TKI. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Despite the advancement of second-generation anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the emergence of resistance and progression of central nervous system metastases remain clinically significant problems in ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer. Lorlatinib is a potent, brain-penetrant, third-generation, macrocyclic ALK/ROS1 TKI, with broad-spectrum potency against most known resistance mutations that can develop during treatment with existing first- and second-generation ALK TKIs.

"Adverse drug reactions, or unintended and harmful outcomes related to the administration of a pharmaceutical product, are a major public health concern, particularly for cancer patients. If counted as a separate cause of death, adverse drug reactions would represent the fourth leading cause of death in the United States. Several legal strategies are available to help mitigate their occurrences and to compensate victims for the harm that results from adverse events. Prior to FDA approval of a drug, the limited size and duration of clinical trials often fail to detect adverse drug reactions. However, after FDA approval, pharmacovigilance efforts are bolstered by recent expansions of FDA post-marketing regulatory powers codified in the 2007 Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act, as well as advances in big data analytics that improve adverse signal detection through data mining of large electronic health records. For victims of adverse drug reactions, tort lawsuits filed in the courts help compensate for the harm suffered and may also serve as warnings to manufacturers to improve drug safety to avoid future legal liability. While encouraging developments have occurred, new and existing legal structures to mitigate and compensate for adverse drug reactions must continue to be refined given increasingly complex pharmaceutical agents.",30552656,Key Elements in Adverse Drug Reactions Safety Signals: Application of Legal Strategies.,0,1

"Abortion remains a highly contentious moral issue, with the debate usually framed as a battle between the fetus's right to life and the woman's right to choose. Often overlooked in this debate is the impact of the concurrent legalization of abortion and the development of new prenatal screening tests on the birth prevalence of many inherited diseases. Most proponents of abortion support abortion for fetuses with severe congenital diseases, but there has unfortunately been, in our opinion, too little debate over the moral appropriateness of abortion for much less severe congenital conditions such as Down's syndrome, deafness, and dwarfism. Due to scientific advances, we are looking at a future in which prenatal diagnosis will be safer and more accurate, raising the specter, and the concomitant ethical concerns, of wholesale abortions.

"Drug-induced diabetes is one of the factors contributing to the increasing incidence of diabetes worldwide. This review considers the frequency, pathogenesis and treatment of drug-induced diabetes. Drugs that induce diabetes include hormonal therapy, especially glucocorticoids and androgen blockers, cardiovascular drugs, especially statins, beta-blockers and diuretics, antipsychotics, especially clozapine, olanzapine and quetiapine, antiretrovirals (protease inhibitors and non-reverse transcriptase inhibitors - NRTIs) and other drugs (mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors -mTORs, post organ transplantation drugs, tyrosine kinase inhibitors and interferon-alpha). Abnormalities of the distal gluco-regulatory pathways of hyperglycemia involve decreased insulin secretion and frequent insulin resistance, whereas the proximal defects are unknown, thus limiting targeted treatment. Drug-induced diabetes is potentially reversible and the risk is underestimated. There is little information on its long-term effects on microvascular complications as clinical trials have not been long enough and neither have they focused on these factors. Overall management includes awareness of a drug's diabetogenic potential, underlying diabetes risk, benefits and risks of continuing vs discontinuing the drug, plus a consideration of drug duration and dose. While diabetes and its severity can be identified and controlled, the likelihood of future diabetes complications frequently cannot. This, balanced against the predicted benefit of the drug, results in clinical uncertainty. Empirical approaches to drug-related hyperglycemia include decreasing the dose or selecting an alternative treatment, if possible. In the absence of drug-specific evidence, treatment of drug-induced hyperglycemia and diabetes is similar to comprehensive standard diabetes care, including lifestyle modifications, oral/injectable antidiabetic agents and insulin. Important clinical considerations include surveillance of glucose before and during treatment and, in some cases, institution of diabetes preventive measures like lifestyle modification and early treatment. Future research is needed to elucidate pathophysiology and optimal targeted treatment for drug-induced diabetes and its long-term complications.",28923179,Drugs and hyperglycemia: A practical guide.,1,1
"Cases with congenital heart defects (CHD) often have other associated anomalies. The purpose of this investigation was to assess the prevalence and the types of associated anomalies in CHD in a defined population. The anomalies associated with CHD were collected in all live births, stillbirths and terminations of pregnancy during 26 years in 346,831 consecutive pregnancies of known outcome in the area covered by our population based registry of congenital anomalies. Of the 4005 cases with CHD born during this period (total prevalence of 115.5 per 10,000), 1055 (26.3%) had associated major anomalies. There were 354 (8.8%) cases with chromosomal abnormalities including 218 trisomies 21, and 99 (2.5%) nonchromosomal recognized dysmorphic conditions. There were no predominant recognized dysmorphic conditions, but VACTERL association. However, other recognized dysmorphic conditions were registered including Noonan syndrome, fetal alcohol syndrome, and skeletal dysplasias. Six hundred and two (15.0%) of the cases had non syndromic, non chromosomal multiple congenital anomalies (MCA). Anomalies in the urinary tract, the musculoskeletal, the digestive, and the central nervous systems were the most common other anomalies. Prenatal diagnosis was obtained in 18.7% of the pregnancies. In conclusion the overall prevalence of associated anomalies, which was one in four infants, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of cases with CHD. A routine screening for other anomalies may be considered in infants and in fetuses with CHD.

"Medication use during pregnancy is gradually increasing; however, the safety of this practice remains largely unknown.We investigated medications with the most adverse drug reactions (ADRs) among pregnant women and the clinical features of those medications.Reports of ADRs among pregnant women were extracted from the Korea Adverse Events Reporting System (January 2012-December 2015). We analyzed the data of drugs frequently reported to cause ADRs and their clinical features among 3 age groups.A total of 5642 ADRs among 3428 patients were analyzed. The number of ADR reports increased annually. The most common drug categories causing ADRs were analgesics, followed by gynecologic, uterotocolytic, anti-infective, antidiabetic, analgesic, and antihypertensive drugs. Analgesics comprised 6 opioids (morphine, fentanyl, hydromorphone, oxycodone, tramadol, pethidine) and an anti-pyretics (nefopam and ketorolac). As an individual drug, ritodrine (24.4%) was the most frequently reported, followed by morphine, 5-HT3 serotonin antagonist, nefopam, fentanyl, magnesium sulfate, insulin lispro, cefazedone, sodium chloride, hydromorphone, oxycodone, cefotetan, nifedipine, human insulin, tramadol, ketorolac, pethidine, methylergometrine, metoclopramide, and misoprostol (in that order). ADRs most frequently occurred in women aged 25 to 34 years, and the trend of ADR with the 20 most commonly reported medications significantly differed among the age groups (P = .011).

"Thyroid hormones are essential development factors and maternal thyroid dysfunction may cause pregnancy complications and diseases in the fetus/child. In the present review we discuss new data on the incidence of Graves'-Basedow disease (GBD) in and around pregnancy, and how hyperthyroidism may affect the risk of spontaneous abortion and stillbirth. A special concern in pregnant women is the potential side effects from the use of antithyroid drugs (ATDs). One type of side effects is the allergic/toxic reactions to the drugs, which seem to be similar in and outside pregnancy, and another is that ATDs tend to over treat the fetus when the mother with GBD is made euthyroid. To avoid fetal hypothyroidism, the lowest possible ATD dose should be used to keep maternal thyroid function at the upper limit of normality with low serum TSH. Birth defects after the use of methimazole (MMI) (or its prodrug carbimazole) have been considered to be very rare, and no risk has previously been associated with the use of propylthiouracil (PTU). However, a recent Danish national study found that 1/30 of children exposed to MMI in early pregnancy had birth defects associated with this, and many defects were severe. PTU exposure was associated with defects in 1/40, and these defects were less severe. Proposals are given on how to reduce the risk of ATD associated birth defects.

"Isolated congenital asplenia is characterized by the absence of a spleen at birth without any other developmental defect. Isolated congenital asplenia is a rare and life-threatening disease that predisposes patients to severe bacterial infections. The first and main genetic etiology of isolated congenital asplenia was discovered in 2013. Mutations in the gene RPSA, which encodes ribosomal protein SA, cause more than half of the cases of isolated congenital asplenia. These disease-causing mutations lead to haploinsufficiency of RPSA. Haploinsufficiency of genes encoding other ribosomal proteins have been reported to cause other developmental defects in humans, and in model organisms like the fly or the mouse. About half of the patients with Diamond-Blackfan anemia, which is a well-characterized ribosomopathy, present developmental defects such as craniofacial defects, cardiac defects or thumb abnormalities. The mechanism of pathogenesis linking mutations in ribosomal proteins, which are highly and ubiquitously expressed, to specific developmental defects remains to be elucidated. One hypothesis is that the ribosome, and ribosomal proteins in particular, regulate the expression of specific genes during development.

"Low cardiac output is one of the most common complications after cardiac surgery. Levosimendan, a new inotrope agent, has been demonstrated in adult patient to be an effective treatment for this purpose when classical therapy is not effective. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of Levosimendan on cardiac output parameters in cardiac children with low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS.). We carried out a retrospective analysis on 62 children hospitalized in our pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) after cardiac surgery, which demonstrated LCOS not responding to classical catecholamine therapy and who received levosimendan as rescue therapy. LCOS parameters like diuresis, central venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>), venous-to-arterial CO<sub>2</sub> difference (∆avCO<sub>2</sub>), and plasmatic lactate were compared before therapy and at 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after the beginning of the levosimendan infusion. We also analyzed the effect on the Vasoactive-inotropic score (VIS), adverse events, and mortality. After the beginning of levosimendan infusion, diuresis (1.1 vs. 3.5 ml/kg/h, p = 0.001) and SvO<sub>2</sub> (59.5 vs. 63.3%, p = 0.026) increased significantly during the 24 h of infusion, and at the same time, plasmatic lactate (2.3 vs. 1.3 mmol/l, p < 0.001) decreased. ∆avCO<sub>2</sub> (10.8 vs. 9.4 mmHg, p = 0.21) and the VIS (44.5 vs. 22.5, p = 0.143) also decreased, but not significantly.

"<b>Background:</b> Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM), a persistent metabolic disorder, is primarily characterized by insulin resistance, relative insulin deficiency and dyslipidemia. Here, we aimed to investigate whether different doses of atorvastatin (ATV) affect rats with T2DM. A total of 110 Sprague-Dawley rats were successfully established as T2DM models. <b>Methods:</b> First, the total cholesterol, triglyceride (TG), high-/low-/very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c/LDL-c/VLDL-c), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), apolipoprotein Al (ApoA1) and apolipoprotein B (ApoB) levels in rat serum were analyzed. In addition, cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) and retinol-binding protein 4 (RBP4) were also measured. Then, the incidence of adverse reactions was noted. Finally, the pathological study of liver and pancreatic tissues was performed. <b>Results:</b> Rats administered ATV at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/(kg·day) showed down-regulated TG, LDL-c, ApoB, CETP and RBP4 levels yet up-regulated HDL-c and ApoAl levels. Rats administered ATV at a dose of 80 mg/(kg·day) exhibited a higher incidence of adverse reactions and higher ALT and AST levels but lower BUN and Cr levels, which might affect liver and kidney function. Rats administered ATV at the doses of 40 and 80 mg/(kg·day) demonstrated significantly improved liver injury and pancreatic injury induced by T2DM. <b>Conclusion:</b> These data revealed that ATV could improve the lipid metabolism in T2DM rats and 40 mg/(kg·day) may serve as the optimal dose for the reduction of lipid levels and the incidence of adverse effects.",31189741,Efficacy and adverse reaction to different doses of atorvastatin in the treatment of type II diabetes mellitus.,0,1

The role of FB in guiding the treatment and safety of procedures was also evaluated. A cohort of 57 children with congenital cardiovascular abnormalities underwent FB for pulmonary diseases between November 2013 and June 2015. The demographics, bronchoscopy diagnoses, cellular analysis and microbiology of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), and the clinically valuable contributions and side-effects of FB were analyzed retrospectively. The bronchoscopies were performed in patients with a median age of 4 months (range, 9 days-9 years) and 9 patients were intubated and mechanically ventilated. The most common types of congenital cardiovascular abnormalities were atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. External compression of airways, tracheobronchomalacia, laryngomalacia, and airway narrowing were the most common airway abnormalities revealed by FB.

"In the past years, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have provided evidence that inter-individual susceptibility to diverse pathological conditions can reveal a common genetic architecture. Through the analysis of congenital heart disease (CHD) and neuroblastoma (NB) GWAS data, we aimed to dissect the genetic susceptibility shared between these conditions, which are known to arise from neural crest cell (NCC) migration or development abnormalities, via identification and functional characterization of common regions of association. Two loci (2q35 and 3q25.32) harbor single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are associated at a <i>p</i>-value < 10<sup>-3</sup> with conotruncal malformations and ventricular septal defect respectively, as well as with NB. In addition, the lead SNP in 4p16.2 for atrial septal defect and the lead SNP in 3q25.32 for tetralogy of Fallot are less than 250 Kb distant from the lead SNPs for NB at the same genomic regions. Some of these shared susceptibility loci regulate the expression of relevant genes involved in NCC formation and developmental processes (such as <i>BARD1,</i><i>MSX1,</i> and <i>SHOX2</i>) and are enriched in several epigenetic markers from NB and fetal heart cell lines. Although the clinical correlation between NB and CHD is unclear, our exploration of a possible common genetic basis between NB and a subset of cardiac malformations can help shed light on their shared embryological origin and pathogenetic mechanisms.",31480262,Exploring Shared Susceptibility between Two Neural Crest Cells Originating Conditions: Neuroblastoma and Congenital Heart Disease.,1,0
"Oseltamivir is recommended for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza in persons at higher risk for influenza complications such as individuals with diabetes, neuropsychiatric illnesses, and respiratory, cardiac, renal, hepatic or haematological diseases. However, a recent Cochrane review reported that reduction of antibody production, renal disorders, hyperglycaemia, psychiatric disorders, and QT prolongation may be related to oseltamivir use. The underlying mechanisms are reviewed. There is decisive evidence that administration of a clinically compatible dose of oseltamivir in mice challenged by a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) that lacks a neuraminidase gene showed symptom-relieving effects and inhibition of viral clearance. These effects were accompanied by decreased level of T cell surface sialoglycosphingolipid (ganglioside) GM1 that is regulated by the endogenous neuraminidase in response to viral challenge. Clinical and non-clinical evidence supports the view that the usual dose of oseltamivir suppresses pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interferon-gamma, interleukin-6, and tumour necrosis factor-alpha almost completely with partial suppression of viral shedding in human influenza virus infection experiment. Animal toxicity tests support the clinical evidence with regard to renal and cardiac disorders (bradycardia and QT prolongation) and do not disprove the metabolic effect. Reduction of antibody production and cytokine induction and renal, metabolic, cardiac, and prolonged psychiatric disorders after oseltamivir use may be related to inhibition of the host's endogenous neuraminidase. While the usual clinical dose of zanamivir may not have this effect, a higher dose or prolonged administration of zanamivir and other neuraminidase inhibitors may induce similar delayed reactions, including reduction of the antibody and/or cytokine production.

"Objective Inconsistent findings of associations between gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and birth defects suggest unaccounted confounders may underlie the actual basis for such associations. We conducted a systematic review to assess observed associations between GDM and birth defects and the extent to which these could be explained by pre-pregnancy obesity. Methods Using a combination of search terms for GDM and birth defects, we searched PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and ClinicalTrials.gov for human-based studies published through September 2013. Studies were eligible for inclusion if they included information on maternal diabetes status, method of diagnosis of GDM, and assessment of birth defects. Twenty-four of 768 potential articles were included. We collected information on study design, location and period, method of determination of diabetes status, types of birth defects, and measures of association reported. Results There was no evidence for consistent association of GDM with birth defects, with the exception of a weak association between GDM and congenital heart defects. When stratified by maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, an association between GDM and congenital heart defects and between GDM and neural tube defects was evident only in women with both GDM and pre-pregnancy obesity. Conclusions for Practice Our findings suggest reported associations between GDM and birth defects may be due, in part, to undiagnosed metabolic disorders associated with obesity, such as pregestational diabetes mellitus, rather than GDM. These findings highlight the need for increased efforts for pre-pregnancy screening for undiagnosed diabetes and awareness of the importance of weight management among women of childbearing age with obesity.",28120287,Pre-pregnancy Obesity as a Modifier of Gestational Diabetes and Birth Defects Associations: A Systematic Review.,0,0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors have ushered in a new era in cancer management. Nivolumab is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody that selectively inhibits programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) activity by binding to the PD-1 receptor. This inhibits suppression of the T-cell activity, which can in turn cause increased killing of cancer cells. This alteration in the activity of the T cells can cause them to lose their ability to identify host cells and leads to immune-related adverse effects (irAE). Nivolumab-induced hepatotoxicity is rare and accounts for 3-6% of all irAE. We present a case of nivolumab-induced hepatitis. A woman who was treated for recurrent renal cell carcinoma presented with hepatitis. Workup for other causes was negative and the hepatitis was attributed to the administration of nivolumab. She was started on oral steroids followed which she initially improved. However, she later presented with massive upper gastrointestinal bleeding secondary to gastroduodenal ulcers and subsequently developed acute tubular necrosis and passed from the complications. Immune checkpoint inhibitors have proven to be a promising approach in the management of a wide array of neoplasms by immunomodulation. As these agents are becoming standard of therapy in the management of cancers, a heightened vigilance in the diagnosis of irAE is warranted. With heightened vigilance, early recognition can lead to decreased mortality and morbidity.",30909794,Nivolumab-induced hepatitis: A rare side effect of an immune check point inhibitor.,0,1

"In this single-center retrospective study, we analyzed kidney transplant outcomes in nine pediatric patients with VACTERL [vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, limb abnormalities] association-making this the largest study of its kind. Of 743 pediatric kidney transplant recipients at our center (1980-2017), nine had documented diagnoses of VACTERL association. All nine had congenital anorectal malformations and renal anomalies, five had vertebral defects, and one had a bifid thumb and tracheoesophageal fistula. Renal anomalies included dysplasia (n = 6), aplasia (n = 3), and horseshoe kidney (n = 2). Congenital lower urinary tract anomalies included neurogenic bladder (n = 6), obstructive uropathy (n = 4), anovesicular fistula (n = 1), rectourethral fistula (n = 1), and posterior urethral valves (n = 1). Age at transplant ranged from 1.2 to 15 years (mean, 7.3; standard deviation [SD], 5.5); 6 (67%) were male, and 3 (33%) were female; 6 (67%) had a living related donor, and 3 (33%) had a deceased donor. The overall graft survival rate was 78% (range, 1.5 to 25.2 years; mean, 10.5; SD, 8.9). One month post-transplant, one recipient died with a functioning graft. At 3.7 years post-transplant, one graft failed because of recurrent pyelonephritis. Post-transplant urologic complications included pyelonephritis (n = 6), vesicoureteral reflux (n = 5), and graft hydronephrosis (n = 4). We conclude that pediatric patients with VACTERL association can be safely transplanted-careful patient selection with vigilance and intervention for pre- and post-transplant urologic complications is essential.",30597716,"Outcomes of kidney transplants in pediatric patients with the vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac defects, tracheoesophageal fistula, renal anomalies, limb abnormalities association.",0,0
"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) contribute to hospitalization but data on its economic burden is scant. Pre-emptive pharmacogenetic (PGx) testing can potentially reduce ADRs and its associated costs. The objectives of this study were to quantify the economic burden of ADRs and to estimate the breakeven cost of pre-emptive PGx testing in Singapore. We collected itemized costs for 1000 random non-elective hospitalizations of adults admitted to a tertiary-care general hospital in Singapore. The presence of ADRs at admission and their clinical characteristics were reported previously. The economic burden of ADRs was assessed from two perspectives: (1) Total cost and (2) incremental costs. The breakeven cost of PGx testing was estimated by dividing avoidable hospitalization costs for ADRs due to selected drugs by the number of patients taking those drugs. The total cost of 81 admissions caused by ADRs was US$570,404. Costs were significantly higher for bleeding/elevated international normalized ratio (US$9906 vs. US$2251, p = 6.58 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) compared to other ADRs, and for drugs acting on the blood coagulation system (US$9884 vs. US$2229, p = 4.41 × 10<sup>-3</sup>) compared to other drug classes. There were higher incremental laboratory costs due to ADRs causing or being present at admission. The estimated breakeven cost of a pre-emptive PGx test for patients taking warfarin, clopidogrel, chemotherapeutic and neuropsychiatric drugs was US$114 per patient. These results suggest that future studies designed to directly measure the clinical and cost impact of a pre-emptive genotyping program will help inform clinical practice and health policy decisions.",30250149,Economic burden of adverse drug reactions and potential for pharmacogenomic testing in Singaporean adults.,0,0

"In order to improve patient safety, systematic analysis of common and repetitive patterns of preventable adverse drug reactions (pADRs) in the clinical setting should be performed regularly in order to propose adequate prevention strategies. Our aim is to evaluate the preventability of all ADRs collected in a drug information research center database, by spontaneous reporting and clinical surveillance in two internal medicine departments. One reviewer systematically reevaluated all the cases stored in the database. ADRs were deemed preventable if they were due to: a contraindication, an inadequate dose, a drug interaction, an inappropriate prescribing decision for the patient's condition, inadequate monitoring, self-medication, or non-adherence to therapy. Out of 251 ADRs evaluated, 103 (41 %) were considered preventable. Out of the total pADRs, 86.4 % were serious. The most frequent adverse outcomes affected the gastrointestinal system (21.4 %), followed by the renal (11.6 %), metabolic (10.7 %), vascular (10.7 %) and hepatic (6.8 %) systems. Acenocoumarol (28 %), diclofenac (12.6 %), digoxin and furosemide accounted for more than 50 % of all preventable reports. One of up to three factors was involved in the preventability of the analyzed reports. Drug-drug interactions were the cause of 49.5 % of the pADRs. Inappropriate dose accounted for 17.5 % reports out of the total pADRs, inappropriate monitoring for 9.7 % reports, history of allergy to drug or drug class for 5.8 % reports and administration of a contraindicated drug for 4.8 % reports. Identifying prevalent pADRs in this study indicates a clear target for prevention strategies: drug prescription, with a special emphasis on drug interactions.",22907809,Preventability analysis of adverse drug reactions detected in two internal medicine departments in Romania.,0,1

"Congenital penile anomalies (CPAs) are among the most common human birth defects. Reports of CPAs, which include hypospadias, chordee, micropenis, and ambiguous genitalia, have risen sharply in recent decades, but the causes of these malformations are rarely identified. Both genetic anomalies and environmental factors, such as antiandrogenic and estrogenic endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are suspected to cause CPAs; however, little is known about the temporal window(s) of sensitivity to EDCs, or the tissue-specific roles and downstream targets of the androgen receptor (AR) in external genitalia. Here, we show that the full spectrum of CPAs can be produced by disrupting AR at different developmental stages and in specific cell types in the mouse genital tubercle. Inactivation of AR during a narrow window of prenatal development results in hypospadias and chordee, whereas earlier disruptions cause ambiguous genitalia and later disruptions cause micropenis. The neonatal phase of penile development is controlled by the balance of AR to estrogen receptor α (ERα) activity; either inhibition of androgen or augmentation of estrogen signaling can induce micropenis. AR and ERα have opposite effects on cell division, apoptosis, and regulation of Hedgehog, fibroblast growth factor, bone morphogenetic protein, and Wnt signaling in the genital tubercle. We identify Indian hedgehog (Ihh) as a novel downstream target of AR in external genitalia and show that conditional deletion of Ihh inhibits penile masculinization. These studies reveal previously unidentified cellular and molecular mechanisms by which antiandrogenic and estrogenic signals induce penile malformations and demonstrate that the timing of endocrine disruption can determine the type of CPA.

"<b>Purpose:</b> The oral BCL-2 inhibitor venetoclax is an effective therapy for patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), including disease with high-risk genomic features such as chromosome 17p deletion [del(17p)] or progressive disease following B-cell receptor pathway inhibitors.<b>Patients and Methods:</b> We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the safety of 400 mg daily venetoclax monotherapy in 350 patients with CLL using an integrated dataset from three phase I/II studies.<b>Results:</b> Median age was 66 years and 60% had del(17p). Patients had received a median of three prior therapies (range: 0-15); 42% previously received ibrutinib or idelalisib. Median duration of exposure to venetoclax was 16 months (0-56). In the pooled analysis, the most common adverse events (AE) of any grade were diarrhea (41%), neutropenia (40%), nausea (39%), anemia (31%), fatigue (28%), and upper respiratory tract infection (25%). The most common grade 3/4 AEs were neutropenia (37%), anemia (17%), and thrombocytopenia (14%). With the current 5-week ramp-up dosing, the incidence of laboratory TLS was 1.4% (2/166), none had clinical sequelae, and all of these patients were able to ramp-up to a daily dose of 400 mg. Grade 3/4 neutropenia was manageable with growth factor support and dose adjustments; the incidence of serious infections in these patients was 15%.

"Bleeding disorders, including haemophilia, von Willebrand disease, and platelet function abnormalities pose a substantial, ongoing management challenge. Patients with these disorders not only require treatment during bleeding events but also need effective management strategies to prepare for events ranging from minor dental procedures to major surgery and childbirth. Moreover, women with bleeding disorders often require ongoing treatment to prevent menorrhagia during childbearing years. Desmopressin (DDAVP), a synthetic derivative of the antidiuretic hormone l-arginine vasopressin, has become a well-established tool for the management of patients with bleeding disorders in a variety of clinical settings. However, despite the widespread use of DDAVP, the available clinical evidence on its efficacy and safety in these settings is limited, and there has not been a recent comprehensive review of its role in the clinical management of patients with bleeding disorders. As such, this article provides a review of the mechanism of action and pharmacokinetic properties of DDAVP, followed by a concise summary of the available evidence for its use in the treatment and prevention of bleeding.

"Coffin-Siris syndrome (CSS) is a developmental disability, caused by genomic variants in the gene <i>SMARCA4</i>, in addition to other known genes, but the full spectrum of <i>SMARCA4</i> variants that can cause CSS is unknown with 40% of cases not having molecular confirmation. In this report, we identify a patient with CSS, a severe cardiac phenotype, and a novel <i>SMARCA4</i> variant. There is no experimental structure of human SMARCA4, so we use molecular modeling techniques to generate a structural model of human SMARCA4. We then map known <i>SMARCA4</i> variants causative of CSS and our novel variant to the model.

Modeling demonstrates that the variant found in our patient is in a region of SMARCA4 associated with DNA binding, as are the other known pathogenic <i>SMARCA4</i> variants mapped.

Many have complications related to their CHD or its treatments, outside the heart, including ocular abnormalities. The objective of this review is to highlight the ocular abnormalities that occur in adults with CHD, either from their condition or related to the common drugs prescribed to manage it. In particular, we reviewed the effects of cyanosis, coarctation of the aorta, endocarditis, and the side effects of Sildenafil and Amiodarone. A change in the retinal vasculature is a common observation with cyanosis or coarctation of the aorta. Occlusion of the retinal vessels may also be observed in cyanotic patients, as well as those with infectious endocarditis. Sildenafil has established ocular side effects; here they are explored in the context of therapy for pulmonary hypertension. Similarly, Amiodarone has established ocular risks, which are summarised.

"COUP-TFII (NR2F2) is mapped to the 15q26 deletion hotspot associated with the common and highly morbid congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). Conditional homozygous deletions of COUP-TFII in mice result in diaphragmatic defects analogous to the human Bochdalek-type hernia phenotype. Despite evidence from animal models however, mutations in the coding sequence of COUP-TFII have not been reported in patients, prompting the speculation that additional coding or non-coding sequences in the 15q26 locus are necessary for diaphragmatic hernias to develop. In this report, we describe a case of a patient with a heterozygous de novo COUP-TFII frameshift mutation, presenting with CDH and an atrial septal defect. The p.Pro33AlafsTer77 mutation specifically disrupts protein isoform 1 which contains the DNA binding domain. In addition, we review other COUP-TFII sequence variations and deletions that have been described in cases of CDH.

This was a retrospective study of eight consecutive bilateral cases (five girls and three boys, with mean age of 4 years, involving 16 knees) with minimum 2-year follow-up. Four patients had multiple congenital contractures and two patients each had popliteal pterygium syndrome and complete tibial hemimelia. All patients were treated with Ilizarov fixator and gradual correction (additional soft tissue releases in three knees). Six patients had bilateral foot and ankle deformity treated with the same fixator, and cases with tibial hemimelia had centralization of fibula and quadriceps reconstruction. Flexion deformity could be corrected in all cases. Mean duration of dynamic phase was 78.5 (55-108) days, that of static phase was 42.4 (7-100) days, and total duration of external fixation was 120.9 (87-186) days. At mean follow-up of 34.5 (23-60) months, flexion deformity improved from the preoperative value of 74.9° (50°-130°) to 13.7° (10°-16°), and passive arc of motion of knee improved from the preoperative value of 38.8° (20°-55°) to 83.6° (55°-110°).

"Chile allows abortion under no circumstances. Whether it's fetal anomaly incompatible with life or congenital malformation resulting in little or no life expectancy, all Chilean women are expected to carry their pregnancies to term. In this context, in January 2015 the Chilean Congress began debating a bill to legalize abortion on three grounds, including fatal congenital malformation. The medical community, including midwives, has presented its views for and against, especially on how the law may affect clinical practices; in addition, women, many of whom have experienced a fatal congenital malformation diagnosis, have weighed in. This qualitative study draws on 22 semi-structured interviews with nine certified nurse-midwives, one neonatologist, nine obstetrician-gynecologists, one psychiatrist, one psychologist, and one sociologist who provide care during gestation, pregnancy, delivery, and post-delivery in the public and private sectors, plus three interviews with two women and the former partner of a woman who underwent the experience. These interviews starkly illustrate the plight facing women carrying nonviable fetuses, including women's shock upon receiving the diagnosis, their feelings of bereavement and loss, and the clinical practices used in an attempt to ease their suffering under the weight of exceedingly difficult legal restrictions.

Assessment of adverse events, assay of lenvatinib C<sub>0</sub>, and analysis of clinical laboratory tests were performed at the same time of day and were retrospectively analyzed. There were no significant differences in lenvatinib C<sub>0</sub> among grades of hypertension, proteinuria, hand-foot syndrome, and diarrhea. However, levels of aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, and total bilirubin were significantly higher in lenvatinib C<sub>0</sub> quartile (Q) 4 (≥ 88 ng/mL) than in Q1 (< 42 ng/mL) and Q2-3 (42-88 ng/mL). Additionally, platelet counts were highest in the lowest Q1 group. The median dose of lenvatinib in patients with UGT1A1*6/*6 or *6/*28 (poor metabolizers [PMs]) was significantly lower than that in patients with UGT1A1*1/*1 (10 and 14 mg, respectively), whereas the median bilirubin levels were significant higher in UGT1A1 PMs (0.9 and 0.5 mg/dL, respectively). There were no significant differences in median lenvatinib C<sub>0</sub> values between patients with UGT1A1*1/*1 and PMs (58.0 and 50.0 ng/mL, respectively).

"The aim of these studies was to check the quality of data collection concerning drug use during pregnancy in the Hungarian Case-Control Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities from four different aspects. (a) The parents of non-respondent cases were visited at home to collect data, but the Ethics Committee did not allow collection of comparable data from non-respondent control women. Thus only 200 selected non-respondent controls were visited at home and questioned about drug use as part of a validation study. There was no difference in the distribution and occurrence of frequently used drugs between the respondent and non-respondent control groups. (b) Data collection was compared between the usual method of the Case-Control Surveillance and personal interview in case with congenital limb deficiencies. In general, the two methods produced similar results with respect to drug use, but the personal interview revealed a higher use of unintended contraceptive pills while the use of antenatal care logbooks in the Case-Control Surveillance showed a higher use of drugs to prevent threatened abortion and preterm delivery. (c) A check of source and completeness of drug exposure showed that about one-quarter of the drugs used during pregnancy were not recorded in the Case-Control Surveillance, and the proportion of lack of recall was about 23%. A small group of women (2.4%) did not use prescribed drugs due to the suspected teratogenic risk. (d) The teratogenic labelling of drugs deters pregnant patients from the use of prescribed drugs, or at least shortens the duration of drug intake.

"Because most medications for pediatric pulmonary hypertension (PH) are used off label and based on adult trials, little information is available on pediatric-specific adverse events (AEs). Although drug manufacturers are required to submit postmarket AE reports to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), this information is rarely transmitted to practitioners. In the setting of a recent FDA warning for sildenafil, the authors sought to give a better description of the AEs associated with current therapies in pediatric PH. In January 2010, a written request was made to the Food and Drug Administration for AE records of commonly used PH medications. Reports were screened for pediatric patients, analyzed in terms of AEs, and compared with the medical literature. Arbitrarily, AEs that could be attributed to concomitant medications were not attributed to the PH medication in question. Adverse events occurring in more than 5 % of events for each drug were assumed to be associated with the targeted PH medication. Between November 1997 and December 2009, 588 pediatric AE reports (death in 257 cases) were reported for the three most commonly used therapies: bosentan, epoprostenol, and sildenafil. Many of the AEs were similar to those reported previously. However, 27 AEs not previously reported in the literature (e.g., pulmonary hemorrhage, hemoptysis, and pneumonia) were found. The FDA postmarket records for PH medications in pediatric patients show a significant number of AEs. The discovery of AEs not previously reported will better inform those caring for these complex and critically ill children, and the large number of deaths suggest they may be underreported in current literature.",23532466,Food and Drug Administration (FDA) postmarket reported side effects and adverse events associated with pulmonary hypertension therapy in pediatric patients.,0,1

"The in utero environment is a key factor controlling the fate of the growing embryo. The deleterious effects of statins during the fetal development are still not very well understood. Data from animal studies and retrospective studies performed in pregnant women give conflicting reports. In this study, using in vitro differentiation model of embryonic stem cells, which mimic the differentiation process of the embryo, we have systematically exposed the cells to lipophilic statins, simvastatin, and atorvastatin at various doses and at critical times during differentiation. The analysis of key genes controlling the differentiation into ecto-, meso- and endodermal lineages was assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Our results show that genes of the mesodermal lineage were most sensitive to statins, leading to changes in the transcript levels of brachyury, Flk-1, Nkx2.5, and α/β-myosin heavy chain. In addition, changes to endodermal marker α-fetoprotein, along with ectodermal Nes and Neurofilament 200 kDa, imply that during early differentiation exposure to these drugs leads to altered signaling, which could translate to the congenital abnormalities seen in the heart and limbs.

"In Iraq, war contamination is the result of dispensed bombs, bullets, detonation of chemical and conventional weapons, and burn-pit emissions by US bases. Increases in congenital anomalies were reported from Iraqi cities post-2003. These cities were heavily bombed and encircled by US bases with burn-pits. Thorium is a radioactive compound and a direct depleted-uranium decay-product. Radioactive materials, including depleted uranium, are routinely stored in US bases and they have been shown to leak into the environment. We conducted a case-control study to investigate associations of residential proximity to Tallil Air Base, a US military base near Nasiriyah, as well as levels of uranium and thorium in hair and deciduous teeth with congenital anomalies. The study was based on a sample of 19 cases and 10 controls who were recruited during late Summer and early Fall of 2016. We developed mixed effects logistic regression models with village as the random effect, congenital anomaly as the outcome and distance to the US base and hair metal levels (one at a time) as the predictor variable, controlling for child's age, sex and paternal education. We also explored the mediation of the association between proximity to the base and congenital anomalies by hair metal levels. We found an inverse association between distance to Tallil Air Base and risk of congenital anomalies and hair levels of thorium and uranium.

"A 68-year-old female with no significant past medical history presented with loss of vision in the lower half of her left eye that lasted <5 minutes. No abnormalities were found on ocular or physical exam. Computed tomography angiography and carotid ultrasound were performed, which confirmed the diagnosis as amaurosis fugax with two abnormalities leading to the transient retinal vessel occlusion. First, it was found that the patient has a congenital vascular anomaly, which consisted most notably of a right-sided aortic arch. This vascular anomaly also consisted of abnormal branching of the left subclavian and common carotid arteries, predisposing the patient to turbulent blood flow and increased risk of the formation of an atherosclerotic plaque at the origin of the common carotid artery. This is an abnormal location for a plaque leading to amaurosis fugax compared to the most common location at the carotid bifurcation. Endarterectomy was not performed because of the difficult location of the plaque and tortuosity of the vessel. Rather, medical intervention with antiplatelet and lipid-lowering therapy was initiated to lower the risk of future retinal or cerebral thromboembolic events.

"Drug side effects levy a massive cost on society through drug failures, morbidity, and mortality cases every year, and their early detection is critically important. Here, we describe the array of model-based phenotype predictors (AMPP), an approach that leverages medical informatics resources and a human genome-scale metabolic model (GSMM) to predict drug side effects. AMPP is substantially predictive (AUC > 0.7) for >70 drug side effects, including very serious ones such as interstitial nephritis and extrapyramidal disorders. We evaluate AMPP's predictive signal through cross-validation, comparison across multiple versions of a side effects database, and co-occurrence analysis of drug side effect associations in scientific abstracts (hypergeometric p value = 2.2e-40). AMPP outperforms a previous biochemical structure-based method in predicting metabolically based side effects (aggregate AUC = 0.65 versus 0.59). Importantly, AMPP enables the identification of key metabolic reactions and biomarkers that are predictive of specific side effects. Taken together, this work lays a foundation for future detection of metabolically grounded side effects during early stages of drug development.

"Offspring of cancer survivors (CS) may be at risk for congenital anomalies due to the mutagenic therapies received by their parents. Our population-based cohort study aimed to investigate the risk for congenital anomalies in offspring of CS compared to offspring of their siblings. Using the Finnish Cancer Registry, Central Population Register, and Hospital Discharge Register, we identified hospital contacts due to congenital anomalies in 6,862 offspring of CS (early-onset cancer between 1953 and 2004) and 35,690 offspring of siblings. Associations between congenital anomalies and cancer were evaluated using generalized linear regression modelling. The ratio of congenital anomalies in offspring of CS (3.2%) was slightly, but non-significantly, elevated compared to that in offspring of siblings (2.7%) [prevalence ratio (PR) 1.07, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.91-1.25]. When offspring of childhood and adolescent survivors (0-19 years at cancer diagnosis) were compared to siblings' offspring, the risk for congenital anomalies was non-significantly increased (PR 1.17, 95% CI 0.92-1.49). No such increase existed for offspring of young adult survivors (20-34 years at cancer diagnosis) (PR 1.01, 95% CI 0.83-1.23). The risks for congenital anomalies were elevated among offspring of CS diagnosed with cancer in the earlier decades (1955-1964: PR 2.77, 95% C I 1.26-6.11; and 1965-1974: PR 1.55, 95% C I 0.94-2.56).

Data originated in 20 Clearinghouse (ICBDSR) affiliated birth defect surveillance systems, reported according to a single pre-established protocol. A total of 257 infants with cyclopia were identified. Overall prevalence was 1 in 100,000 births (95%CI: 0.89-1.14), with only one program being out of range. Across sites, there was no correlation between cyclopia prevalence and number of births (r = 0.08; P = 0.75) or proportion of elective termination of pregnancy (r = -0.01; P = 0.97). The higher prevalence of cyclopia among older mothers (older than 34) was not statistically significant. The majority of cases were liveborn (122/200; 61%) and females predominated (male/total: 42%). A substantial proportion of cyclopias (31%) were caused by chromosomal anomalies, mainly trisomy 13. Another 31% of the cases of cyclopias were associated with defects not typically related to HPE, with more hydrocephalus, heterotaxia defects, neural tube defects, and preaxial reduction defects than the chromosomal group, suggesting the presence of ciliopathies or other unrecognized syndromes.

The cumulative incidence of subsequent acquired conditions, such as thyroid disease, hearing loss, overweight/obesity, dyslipidemia and, to a lesser extent, celiac disease, glucose intolerance/type 2 diabetes, hypertension and liver dysfunction increased with age, but less markedly for patients with mosaicism than for those with other karyotypes. Patients with a ring chromosome were more prone to metabolic disorders. Conclusion These data suggest that X gene chromosome dosage, particularly for Xp genes, contributes to the risk of developing comorbidities.",30991358,"X chromosome gene dosage as a determinant of congenital malformations and of age-related comorbidity risk in patients with Turner syndrome, from childhood to early adulthood.",1,0
"Background Disagreement among healthcare professionals on the clinical relevance of drug-related problems can lead to suboptimal treatment and increased healthcare costs. Elderly patients with chronic non-cancer pain and comorbidity are at increased risk of drug related problems compared to other patient groups due to complex medication regimes and transition of care. Objective To investigate the agreement among healthcare professionals on their classification of clinical relevance of drug-related problems in elderly patients with chronic non-cancer pain and comorbidity. Setting Multidisciplinary Pain Centre, Rigshospitalet, Copenhagen, Denmark. Method A pharmacist performed medication review on elderly patients with chronic non-cancer pain and comorbidity, identified their drug-related problems and classified these problems in accordance with an existing categorization system. A five-member clinical panel rated the drug-related problems' clinical relevance in accordance with a five-level rating scale, and their agreement was compared using Fleiss' κ. Main outcome measure Healthcare professionals' agreement on clinical relevance of drug related problems, using Fleiss' κ. Results Thirty patients were included in the study. A total of 162 drug related problems were identified, out of which 54% were of lower clinical relevance (level 0-2) and 46% of higher clinical relevance (level 3-4). Only slight agreement (κ = 0.12) was found between the panellists' classifications of clinical relevance using a five-level rating scale. Conclusion The clinical pharmacist identified drug related problems of lower and higher clinical relevance. Poor overall agreement on the severity of the drug related problems was found among the panelists.",29248987,Healthcare professionals' agreement on clinical relevance of drug-related problems among elderly patients.,0,1

"Significant noncardiac and genetic abnormalities (NC and GA) are common in neonates with congenital heart defects. We sought to examine current-era effect of those abnormalities on early and late outcomes following cardiac surgery. The method from 2002-2012, 1538 neonates underwent repair (n = 860, 56%) or palliation (n = 678, 44%) of congenital heart defects. Regression models examined the effect of NC and GA on operative results, resource utilization, and late outcomes. Neonates with NC and GA (n = 312, 20%) had higher incidence of prematurity (21% vs 13%; P < 0.001) and weight ≤2.5kg (24% vs 12%; P < 0.001) than neonates without NC and GA (n = 1226, 80%). Although the incidence of single ventricle was comparable (34% vs 31%; P = 0.37), neonates with NC and GA underwent more palliation (52% vs 42%; P = 0.001) and subsequently had higher percentage of STAT mortality categories (Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) and the European Association for Cardio-thoracic Surgery (EACTS) Congenital Heart Surgery Mortality Categories) 4 and 5 procedures (78% vs 66%; P < 0.001). Adjusted logistic regression models that included disparate patient and operative variables showed that the presence of NC and GA was associated with increased unplanned reoperation (odds ratio = 1.7; 95% CI: 1.1-2.7; P = 0.03) and hospital mortality (odds ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.3-3.6; P = 0.002). Adjusted linear regression models showed significant association between NC and GA and increased postoperative mechanical ventilation duration, intensive care unit, and hospital stays (P < 0.001 each). Adjusted hazard analysis showed that the presence of NC and GA was associated with diminished late survival (hazard ratio = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.9-3.1; P < 0.001) and that was evident in all subgroups of patients (P < 0.001 each). Conclusion is neonates with NC and GA commonly have associated risk factors for morbidity and mortality such as prematurity and low weight. After adjusting for those factors, the presence of NC and GA continues to have significant association with increased unplanned reoperation, hospital mortality, and resource utilization after palliative and corrective cardiac surgery. Importantly, the hazard of death in those patients continues beyond the perioperative period for at least 1 year. Our findings show that the presence of NC and GA should be emphasized during parent counseling and decision making; and underscore the need to explore strategies to improve outcomes for this high-risk population that must address perioperative care, outpatient surveillance, and management.

"Drug attrition and clinical product withdrawals due to nephrotoxicity remain major challenges for pharmaceutical drug development pipelines. Currently, no reliable high-throughput in vitro screening models are available that provide reliable, predictive toxicology data for clinical nephrotoxicity. Drug screens to predict toxicity and pharmacology assessments are compromised by standard two-dimensional (2D) cell monoculture models. Here we extend a previously reported murine three-dimensional (3D) kidney-derived intact proximal tubule model to provide ex vivo drug toxicity data that reliably compare to clinical experiences and improve nephrotoxicity predictions over current 2D cell assays. Proximal tubule cytotoxicity was monitored by ATP depletion for 12 compounds (acarbose, acetylsalicylic acid, captopril, cimetidine, cidofovir, cisplatin, doxorubicin, gentamicin, polymyxin B, polymyxin B nonapeptide, probenecid and vancomycin) in 3D proximal tubule ex vivo assays. Drug concentration-response curves (1-1000 µM) and IC<sub>50</sub>, lowest effective concentration (LEC) and AUC values were compared to clinical therapeutic exposure levels (C<sub>max</sub>). The 100-fold C<sub>max</sub> threshold demonstrated best sensitivity (96.9%) and specificity (87.5%) for this assay, with high positive (93.9%) and negative (93.3%) predictive values for nephrotoxicity. IC<sub>50</sub> values were superior to LEC. Results also support the model's capability to predict substrate-inhibitor/competitor interactions, yielding toxicity results similar to those reported in vivo. These 3D proximal tubule-based drug screens provide more reliable nephrotoxicity predictions, and more insight into complex mechanisms implicated in nephrotoxicity than current standard 2D cell assays. This new approach for rapid drug toxicity testing produces more reliable clinical comparisons than current 2D cell culture screening techniques.",30863989,A murine ex vivo 3D kidney proximal tubule model predicts clinical drug-induced nephrotoxicity.,0,0
"A traditional infectious disease vaccine is a preparation of live attenuated, inactivated or killed pathogen that stimulates immunity. Vaccine immunologic adjuvants are compounds incorporated into vaccines to enhance immunogenicity. Adjuvants have recently been implicated in the new syndrome named ASIA autoimmune/inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants. The objective describes the frequencies of post-vaccination clinical syndrome induced by adjuvants. We performed a cross-sectional study; adverse event following immunization was defined as any untoward medical occurrence that follows immunization 54 days prior to the event. Data on vaccinations and other risk factors were obtained from daily epidemiologic surveillance. Descriptive statistics were done using means and standard deviation, and odds ratio adjusted for potential confounding variables was calculated with SPSS 17 software. Forty-three out of 120 patients with moderate or severe manifestations following immunization were hospitalized from 2008 to 2011. All patients fulfilled at least 2 major and 1 minor criteria suggested by Shoenfeld and Agmon-Levin for ASIA diagnosis. The most frequent clinical findings were pyrexia 68%, arthralgias 47%, cutaneous disorders 33%, muscle weakness 16% and myalgias 14%. Three patients had diagnosis of Guillain-Barre syndrome, one patient had Adult-Still's disease 3 days after vaccination. A total of 76% of the events occurred in the first 3 days post-vaccination. Two patients with previous autoimmune disease showed severe adverse reactions with the reactivation of their illness. Minor local reactions were present in 49% of patients.

"Causality assessment is a fundamental biomedical technique for the signal detection performed by Pharmacovigilance centers in a Spontaneous reporting system. Moreover, it is a crucial and important practice for detecting preventable adverse drug reactions. Among different methods for causality assessment, algorithms (such as the Naranjo, or Begaud Methods) seem for their operational procedure and easier applicability one of the most commonly used methods. With the upcoming of the new European Pharmacovigilance legislation including in the definition of the adverse event also effects resulting from abuse, misuse and medication error, all well-known preventable causes of ADRs, there was an emerging need to evaluate whether algorithms could fulfill this new definition. In this review, twenty-two algorithmic methods were identified and none of them seemed to fulfill perfectly the new criteria of adverse event although some of them come close. In fact, several issues were arisen in applying causality assessment algorithms to these new definitions as for example the impossibility to answer the rechallenge question in case of medication error or AEFI (Adverse Event Following Immunization). Moreover, the exact conditions at which events occurred, as for example dosage or mode of administration should be considered to better assess causality in conditions of abuse/overdose, or misuse as well as in conditions of lack of expected efficacy reports for biotechnological drugs and adverse event occurring after mixing of vaccines. Therefore, this review highlights the need of updating algorithmic methods to allow a perfect applicability in all possible clinical scenarios accordingly or not with the terms of marketing authorization.",28694146,Can causality assessment fulfill the new European definition of adverse drug reaction?

"Reports on the incidence of persistent left superior vena cava (PLSVC) in the normal population are limited to studies involving pacemaker implantation candidates and cadavers. The incidence in patients with congenital heart diseases (CHDs) is estimated to be higher than that in the normal population; however, the details are unclear. To investigate the incidence of PLSVC in the normal population and in patients with CHDs, subjects were examined prospectively using echocardiography. Normal subjects consisted of 2841 successive neonates without intra-cardiac or congenital anomalies born in Gifu Prefectural General Medical Center. Additionally, 1920 patients with CHDs were evaluated. The incidence of PLSVC in normal neonates was 0.21% (95% confidence interval 0.042-0.38%).

This study proposes a method that uses diverse information such as drug-drug interactions from DrugBank, drug-drug interactions from network, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and side effect anatomical hierarchy as well as chemical structures, indications, and targets. The proposed method is based on the assumption that properties used in drug repositioning studies could be utilized to predict side effects because the phenotypic expression of a side effect is similar to that of the disease. The prediction results using the proposed method showed a 3.5% improvement in the area under the curve (AUC) over that obtained when only chemical, indication, and target features were used. The random forest model delivered outstanding results for all combinations of feature types.

"In vivo toxicity and absorption studies of topical ocular drugs are problematic, because these studies involve invasive tissue sampling and toxic effects in animal models. Therefore, different human corneal models ranging from simple monolayer cultures to three-dimensional models have been developed for toxicological prediction with in vitro models.

Use of non-corneal cells, inadequate characterization of gene-expression profiles, and accumulation of genomic aberrations in human corneal models are typical drawbacks that decrease their reliability and predictive power. In the future, further improvements are needed for verifying comparable expression profiles and cellular properties of human corneal models with their in vivo counterparts. A rapidly expanding stem cell technology combined with tissue engineering may give future opportunities to develop new tools in drug toxicity studies. One approach may be the production of artificial miniature corneas.

"The absence of inferior vena cava (IVC) is one among infrequent subtypes of IVC abnormalities that are rarely seen in general population.

The absence of the entire IVC is thought to be a result of an embryologic disorder, whereas perinatal thrombosis is hypothesised to lead to the development of absent infrarenal IVC, thus the latter is a developmental disorder and the former occurs due to embryologic disorder. We report an adult man with renal-infrarenal absence of IVC, as well as missing common iliac veins.

"Adverse events in clinical drug trials are often poorly assessed and reported. The absence of baseline assessment and structured symptom lists, as well as the fact that most drug trials are industry-sponsored are common sources of bias. In addition, adverse events are usually assessed in patient samples, which can bias results because of the misattribution of symptoms that are part of the illness to medication intake. We aimed to identify amitriptyline's placebo- and baseline-controlled side effects by examining a sample of healthy adults, using structured assessments via a symptom list. Forty healthy individuals were randomized equally to either a group taking 50 mg amitriptyline on four consecutive days or to a placebo control group. Complaints were assessed via the Generic Assessment of Side Effects Scale prior to and after four days of medication intake. Frequency of complaints and their intensity were compared after medication intake between the two groups while controlling for complaints at baseline. The amitriptyline group's participants reported having suffered from ""dry mouth,"" ""dizziness,"" ""subjective blood circulation-associated problems,"" and ""constipation"" significantly more often. When taking into account the complaint's intensity, the amitriptyline group also reported higher intensities for ""dry mouth,"" ""dizziness,"" and ""subjective blood circulation-associated problems.""

"The vast majority of information regarding the teratogenicity of new drugs as well as others for which adequate information is not available comes from postmarketing studies. Evaluation by a dysmorphologist of babies prenatally exposed to a particular agent has played an incredibly important role in these studies. Most of the known human teratogens have been identified by the astute clinician approach which involves the observation, documentation, and delineation of individual cases who display a novel phenotype after a particularly rare prenatal exposure. Prospective cohort studies focused on the evaluation of prenatally exposed children who have been ascertained prospectively prior to the known outcome of pregnancy and evaluated by a dysmorphologist for patterns of minor and major malformations have been equally effective. Although most human teratogens have been identified using one of these two methods, both have limitations. The purpose of this study is to set forth the extent to which a careful physical examination performed by a dysmorphologist trained in the identification of minor structural defects in development has added to our knowledge of human teratology and has been instrumental in the identification of new human teratogens. Although dysmorphologists have had a profound impact on our understanding of human teratogens.

The completeness score was determined out of a total of 100 points, based on the presence of information on temporal relationships, age and sex of patients, AE progress, name of reported medication, reporting group by profession, causality assessment, and informational text. AE reports were organized into four groups based on affiliation: hospitals/clinics, pharmacies, consumers, and pharmaceutical companies. Affiliations that had median completeness scores greater than 80 points were classified as 'well-documented' and these reports were further analyzed by logistic regression to estimate the adjusted odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals. We examined 228,848 individual reports and 735,745 drug-AE combinations. The median values of the completeness scores were the highest for hospitals/clinics (95 points), followed by those for consumers (85), pharmacies (75), and manufacturers (72). Reports with causality assessment of 'certain', 'probable', or 'possible' were more likely to be 'well-documented' than reports that had causality assessments of 'unlikely'. Serious reports of AEs were positively associated with 'well-documented' reports and negatively associated with hospitals/clinics.",30763386,"Differential completeness of spontaneous adverse event reports among hospitals/clinics, pharmacies, consumers, and pharmaceutical companies in South Korea.",0,0

"The propensity of drugs to cause a potentially fatal arrhythmia, torsades des pointes (TdP), is a significant public health issue. The draft International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) S7B guidelines describe a battery of non-clinical studies to evaluate a drug's potential to prolong ventricular repolarization (VR); an accepted surrogate/risk factor for TdP. A worldwide survey of pharmaceutical industry practices, related to ICH S7B was conducted. The findings were presented at the 4th Annual Meeting of the Safety Pharmacology Society (SPS) meeting (Cincinnati, OH, Sept., 2004).",15975833,Non-clinical evaluation of ventricular repolarization (ICH S7B): results of an interim survey of international pharmaceutical companies.,1,1
