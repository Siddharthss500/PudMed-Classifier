"Click chemistry refers to a group of reactions that are fast, simple to use, easy to purify, versatile, regiospecific, and give high product yields. Therefore, a novel, efficient magnetic nano-sorbent based on N-methyl-D-glucamine attached to magnetic nanoparticles was prepared using click coupling method. Its boron sorption capacity was compared with N-methyl-D-glucamine direct attached nano-sorbent. The characterization of the magnetic sorbents was investigated by several techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The boron sorption capacity of sorbents was compared by studying various essential factors influencing the sorption, like sorbate concentration, sorbents dosage, pH of the solution, and contact time. Langmuir and Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption isotherms models were applied. Percent removal and sorption capacities efficiencies of sorbents obtained with direct and click coupling are found to be 49.5%, 98.7% and 6.68 mg/g, 13.44 mg/g respectively. Both sorbents have been found to be compatible with Langmuir isotherm, and the boron sorption kinetics conforms to the pseudo second order kinetics. The reusability study of sorbents was carried out five times for boron sorption and desorption.",29990737,Synthesis of novel magnetic nano-sorbent functionalized with N-methyl-D-glucamine by click chemistry and removal of boron with magnetic separation method.,1,0
"Click chemistry, one of the most important methods in conjugation, plays an extremely significant role in the synthesis of functional aliphatic polycarbonates, which are a group of biodegradable polymers containing carbonate bonds in their main chains. To date, more than 75 articles have been reported on the topic of click chemistry in functional aliphatic polycarbonates. However, these efforts have not yet been highlighted. Six categories of click reactions (alkyne-azide reaction, thiol-ene reaction, Michael addition, epoxy-amine/thiol reaction, Diels-Alder reaction, and imine formation) that have been afforded for further post-polymerization modification of polycarbonates are reviewed. Through this review, a comprehensive understanding of functional aliphatic polycarbonates aims to afford insight on the design of polycarbonates for further post-polymerization modification via click chemistry and the expectation of the practical application.",28795456,Click Chemistry in Functional Aliphatic Polycarbonates.,1,0
"Click chemistry is an immensely powerful technique for the fast and efficient covalent conjugation of molecular entities. Its broad scope has positively impacted on multiple scientific disciplines, and its implementation within the nucleic acid field has enabled researchers to generate a wide variety of tools with application in biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. Azide-alkyne cycloadditions (AAC) are still the leading technology among click reactions due to the facile modification and incorporation of azide and alkyne groups within biological scaffolds. Application of AAC chemistry to nucleic acids allows labeling, ligation, and cyclization of oligonucleotides efficiently and cost-effectively relative to previously used chemical and enzymatic techniques. In this review, we provide a guide to inexperienced and knowledgeable researchers approaching the field of click chemistry with nucleic acids. We discuss in detail the chemistry, the available modified-nucleosides, and applications of AAC reactions in nucleic acid chemistry and provide a critical view of the advantages, limitations, and open-questions within the field.",33443411,A Hitchhiker's Guide to Click-Chemistry with Nucleic Acids.,1,0
"A one-bead one-compound (OBOC) library of peptide-based imaging agents was developed where a <sup>19</sup>F-containing moiety was added onto the N-terminus of octamer peptides through copper-free click chemistry prior to screening of the library. This created a library of complete imaging agents that was screened against CXCR4, a receptor of interest for cancer imaging. The screen directly resulted in the discovery of a peptide-based imaging agent with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 138 μM. This proof-of-concept study describes a new type of OBOC peptide library design, where hits discovered from screening can be easily translated into their fluorine-18 counterpart for PET imaging without loss of affinity.",32011850,Incorporation of Fluorine into an OBOC Peptide Library by Copper-Free Click Chemistry toward the Discovery of PET Imaging Agents.,1,0

"This review focuses on the application of click chemistry in medicinal sciences, and particularly on its role in drug discovery. Because of its high modularity, click chemistry helps to accelerate the current drug discovery process, which relies on massive screening of chemical libraries. This article describes examples of click chemistry applications that are aimed at finding new lead candidates against pathologies such as cancer, AIDS and Alzheimer's disease, and explores the impact that the technique could have in therapy and prevention in the near future, through application in drug delivery systems, bioconjugation and diagnostic. An introduction, addressed to researchers who intend to use this methodology, examines the opportunities to perform click reactions according to the most common and best studied techniques, such as synthesis in water, on solid phase, and under microwave or ultrasound irradiation.

"The development of new bio-orthogonal ligation methods for the conjugation of native proteins is of particular importance in the field of chemical biology and biotherapies. In this work, we developed a traceless electrochemical method for protein bioconjugation. The electrochemically promoted tyrosine-click (e-Y-CLICK) allowed the chemoselective Y-modification of peptides and proteins with labeled urazoles. A low potential is applied in an electrochemical cell to activate urazole anchors in situ and on demand, without affecting the electroactive amino acids from the protein. The versatility of the electrosynthetic approach was shown on biologically relevant peptides and proteins such as oxytocin, angiotensin 2, serum bovine albumin, and epratuzumab. The fully conserved enzymatic activity of a glucose oxidase observed after e-Y-CLICK further highlights the softness of the method. The e-Y-CLICK protocols were successfully performed in pure aqueous buffers, without the need for co-solvents, scavenger or oxidizing chemicals, and should therefore significantly broaden the scope of bioconjugation.",30422648,Electrochemically Promoted Tyrosine-Click-Chemistry for Protein Labeling.,1,0
"HIV-1 RT has been considered as one of the most important targets for the development of anti-HIV-1 drugs for their well-solved three-dimensional structure and well-known mechanism of action. In this study, with HIV-1 RT as target, we used miniaturized parallel click chemistry synthesis via CuAAC reaction followed by in situ biological screening to discover novel potent HIV-1 NNRTIs. A 156 triazole-containing inhibitor library was assembled in microtiter plates and in millimolar scale. The enzyme inhibition screening results showed that 22 compounds exhibited improved inhibitory activity. Anti-HIV-1 activity results demonstrated that A3N19 effected the most potent activity against HIV-1 IIIB (EC<sub>50</sub> = 3.28 nM) and mutant strain RES056 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 481 nM). The molecular simulation analysis suggested that the hydrogen bonding interactions of A3N19 with the main chain of Lys101 and Lys104 was responsible for its potency. Overall, the results indicated the in situ click chemistry-based strategy was rational and might be amenable for the future discovery of more potent HIV-1 NNRTIs.",32200201,In situ click chemistry-based rapid discovery of novel HIV-1 NNRTIs by exploiting the hydrophobic channel and tolerant regions of NNIBP.,1,0
"Surface modifications with tethered growth factors have mainly been applied to synthetic polymeric biomaterials in well-controlled, acellular settings, followed by seeding with cells. The known bio-orthogonality of copper-free click chemistry provides an opportunity to not only use it in vitro to create scaffolds or pro-migratory tracks in the presence of living cells, but also potentially apply it to living tissues directly as a coupling modality in situ. In this study, we studied the chemical coupling of growth factors to collagen using biocompatible copper-free click chemistry and its effect on the enhancement of growth factor activity in vitro. We verified the characteristics of modified epidermal growth factor (EGF) using mass spectrometry and an EGF/EGF receptor binding assay, and evaluated the chemical immobilization of EGF on collagen by copper-free click chemistry using surface X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the anchoring was noncytotoxic, biocompatible, and rapid. Moreover, the surface-immobilized EGF had significant effects on epithelial cell attachment and proliferation. Our results demonstrate the possibility of copper-free click chemistry as a tool for covalent bonding of growth factors to collagen in the presence of living cells. This approach is a novel and potentially clinically useful application of copper-free click chemistry as a way of anchoring growth factors to collagen and foster epithelial wound healing.",28598594,Tethering Growth Factors to Collagen Surfaces Using Copper-Free Click Chemistry: Surface Characterization and in Vitro Biological Response.,1,0
"A click reaction is reported here for the first time as a useful technique to control the conformational stability of natural organic matter (NOM) suprastructures. Click conjugates were successfully formed between a previously butynylated NOM hydrophobic fraction and a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG)-amino chain. The click products were shown by size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) hyphenated with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) in electrospray ionization (ESI) (+), while precursors were visible in ESI (-). Despite their increase in molecular weight, HPSEC elution of click conjugates occurred after that of precursors, thus showing their departure from the NOM supramolecular association. This indicates that the click-conjugated NOM molecules were varied in their hydrophilic and cationic character and lost the capacity to accommodate in the original hydrophobic suprastructures. The most abundant product had the C16H30O5N4 formula, a click conjugate of butanoic acid, while other products were short-chained (C4-C8) linear unsaturated and hydroxylated carboxylic acids. Tandem MS revealed formation of triazole rings in clicked conjugates and their two fragmentations at the ester and the C-N alkyl-aryl bonds. The behavior of NOM molecules modified by click chemistry confirms that hydrophobicity and ionic charge of humic molecules play a pivotal role in stabilizing intermolecular forces in NOM. Moreover, the versatility of the click reaction may become useful to decorate NOM molecules with a variety of substrates, in order to alter NOM conformational and chemical properties and diversify its applications in the environment.

"Bacterial infections pose mounting public health concerns and cause an enormous medical and financial burden today. Rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria at the point of care (POC) remains a paramount challenge. Here, we report a novel concept of bacteria-instructed click chemistry and employ it for POC microbial sensing. In this concept of bacteria-instructed click chemistry, we demonstrate for the first time that pathogenic bacteria can capture and reduce exogenous Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup> by leveraging their unique metabolic processes. The produced Cu<sup>+</sup> subsequently acts as a catalyst to trigger the click reaction between gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with azide and alkyne functional molecules, resulting in the aggregation of nanoparticles with a color change of the solution from red to blue. In this process, signal amplification from click chemistry is complied with the aggregation of functionalized AuNPs, thus presenting a robust colorimetric strategy for sensitive POC sensing of pathogenic bacteria. Notably, this colorimetric strategy is easily integrated in a smartphone app as a portable platform to achieve one-click detection in a mobile way. Moreover, with the help of the magnetic preseparation process, this smartphone app-assisted platform enables rapid (within 1 h) detection of Escherichia coli with high sensitivity (40 colony-forming units/mL) in the complex artificial sepsis blood samples, showing great potential for clinical early diagnosis of bacterial infections.",31184853,Bacteria-Instructed Click Chemistry between Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles for Point-of-Care Microbial Detection.,1,0
"The advent of click chemistry has had a profound influence on almost all branches of chemical science. This is particularly true of radiochemistry and the synthesis of agents for positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and targeted radiotherapy. The selectivity, ease, rapidity, and modularity of click ligations make them nearly ideally suited for the construction of radiotracers, a process that often involves working with biomolecules in aqueous conditions with inexorably decaying radioisotopes. In the following pages, our goal is to provide a broad overview of the first 10 years of research at the intersection of click chemistry and radiochemistry. The discussion will focus on four areas that we believe underscore the critical advantages provided by click chemistry: (i) the use of prosthetic groups for radiolabeling reactions, (ii) the creation of coordination scaffolds for radiometals, (iii) the site-specific radiolabeling of proteins and peptides, and (iv) the development of strategies for in vivo pretargeting. Particular emphasis will be placed on the four most prevalent click reactions-the Cu-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC), the strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC), the inverse electron demand Diels-Alder reaction (IEDDA), and the Staudinger ligation-although less well-known click ligations will be discussed as well. Ultimately, it is our hope that this review will not only serve to educate readers but will also act as a springboard, inspiring synthetic chemists and radiochemists alike to harness click chemistry in even more innovative and ambitious ways as we embark upon the second decade of this fruitful collaboration.",27787983,Click Chemistry and Radiochemistry: The First 10 Years.,1,0
"Metabolic sugar labeling followed by the use of reagent-free click chemistry is an established technique for in vitro cell targeting. However, selective metabolic labeling of the target tissues in vivo remains a challenge to overcome, which has prohibited the use of this technique for targeted in vivo applications. Herein, we report the use of targeted ultrasound pulses to induce the release of tetraacetyl N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4 ManAz) from microbubbles (MBs) and its metabolic expression in the cancer area. Ac4 ManAz-loaded MBs showed great stability under physiological conditions, but rapidly collapsed in the presence of tumor-localized ultrasound pulses. The released Ac4 ManAz from MBs was able to label 4T1 tumor cells with azido groups and significantly improved the tumor accumulation of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-Cy5 by subsequent click chemistry. We demonstrated for the first time that Ac4 ManAz-loaded MBs coupled with the use of targeted ultrasound could be a simple but powerful tool for in vivo cancer-selective labeling and targeted cancer therapies.",27010510,Targeted Ultrasound-Assisted Cancer-Selective Chemical Labeling and Subsequent Cancer Imaging using Click Chemistry.,1,0
"Metabolic glycoengineering is a powerful technique that can introduce various chemical groups to cellular glycan by treatment of unnatural monosaccharide. Particularly, this technique has enabled many challenging trials for molecular imaging in combination with click chemistry, which provides fast and specific chemical conjugation reaction of imaging probes to metabolically-modified live cells. This review introduces recent progress in molecular imaging based on the combination of these two cutting-edge techniques. First, these techniques showed promising results in specific tumor cell imaging for cancer diagnosis and therapy. The related researches showed the surface of tumor cells could be labeled with bioorthogonal chemical groups by metabolic glycoengineering, which can be further conjugated with fluorescence dyes or nanoparticles with imaging probes by click chemistry, in vitro and in vivo. This method can be applied to heterogeneous tumor cells regardless of genetic properties of different tumor cells. Furthermore, the amount of targeting moieties on tumor cells can be freely controlled externally by treatment of unnatural monosaccharide. Second, this sequential use of metabolic glycoengineering and click chemistry is also useful in cell tracking to monitor the localization of the inoculated therapeutic cells including chondrocytes and stem cells. This therapeutic cell-labeling technique provided excellent viability of chondrocytes and stem cells during the whole process in vitro and in vivo. It can provide long-term and safe therapeutic cell imaging compared to traditional methods.

"Cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein phosphatases play key roles in the transition between the cell cycle phases and their association with various cancers has been widely proven, which makes them ideal targets for anti-cancer treatment. Though several Cdc25 inhibitors have been developed, most of them displayed low activity and poor subtype selectivity. Therefore, it is extremely important to discover novel small molecule inhibitors with potent activities and significant selectivity for Cdc25 subtypes, not only served as drugs to treat cancer but also to probe its mechanism in transitions. In this study, miniaturized parallel click chemistry synthesis via CuAAC reaction followed by in situ biological screening were used to discover selective Cdc25 inhibitors. The bioassay results showed that compound M2N12 proved to be the most potent Cdc25 inhibitor, which also act as a highly selective Cdc25C inhibitor and was about 9-fold potent than that of NSC 663284. Moreover, M2N12 showed remarkable anti-growth activity against the KB-VIN cell line, equivalent to that of PXL and NSC 663284. An all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach was further employed to probe the significant selectivity of M2N12 for Cdc25C relative to its structural homologs Cdc25A and Cdc25B. Overall, above results make M2N12 a promising lead compound for further investigation and structural modification.",31541869,Identification of highly potent and selective Cdc25 protein phosphatases inhibitors from miniaturization click-chemistry-based combinatorial libraries.,1,0
"Albumin is one of the most attractive nanoplatforms for targeted imaging and drug delivery due to its biocompatibility and long circulation half-life. However, previously reported albumin-based nanoplatforms have shown inconsistent blood circulation half-life according to the modified methods, and the affecting factors were not well evaluated, which could hamper the clinical translation of albumin-based nanoplatforms. Herein, we developed a finely tuned click-chemistry based albumin nanoplatform (CAN) with a longer circulation half-life and an efficient tumor targeting ability. <b>Methods:</b> CAN was synthesized in two steps. First, albumin was conjugated with ADIBO-NHS (albumin-ADIBO) by reacting albumin with various molar ratios of ADIBO. The number of attached ADIBO moieties was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Second, the desired modalities including azide-functionalized chelator, a fluorescence dye, and folate were incorporated into albumin-ADIBO using strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (SPAAC reaction). The biodistribution and targeting efficiency of functionalized CANs were demonstrated in mice. <b>Results:</b> The degree of functionalization (DOF) and resulting <i>in vivo</i> biodistribution was controlled precisely using the click chemistry approach. Specifically, the numbers of attached azadibenzocyclooctyne (ADIBO) moieties on albumin, the DOF, were optimized by reacting albumin with varying molar ratios of ADIBO with a high reproducibility. Furthermore, we developed a simple and efficient method to estimate the DOF using <i>UV</i>-<i>visible</i> spectrophotometry (UV-vis), which was further validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). The biodistribution of CAN could be controlled by DOF, and CAN with an optimized DOF showed a long circulation half-life (> 18 h). CAN was further functionalized using a simple click chemistry reaction with an azide functionalized chelator, a fluorescence dye, and folate. <sup>64</sup>Cu- and folate-labeled CAN (<sup>64</sup>Cu-CAN-FA) showed effective and specific folate receptor targeting <i>in vivo</i>, with an over two-fold higher uptake than the liver at 24 h post-injection. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our development from the precisely controlled DOF demonstrates that an optimized CAN can be used as a multifunctional nanoplatform to obtain a longer half-life with radioisotopes and ligands, and provides an effective method for the development of albumin-based tumor theranostic agents.",31281486,Versatile and Finely Tuned Albumin Nanoplatform based on Click Chemistry.,1,0
"Azide-alkyne cycloaddition is a powerful reaction for the formation of bioconjugates. When catalyzed by Cu(I) or strain promotion, this cycloaddition is considered to be a ""click"" reaction with many applications in chemical biology and materials science. We report a new type of azide-alkyne click chemistry for the synthesis of protein conjugates using cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) supramolecular chemistry. CB6-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition has been previously used for the synthesis of rotaxanes but has not been applied to the development of complex bioconjugates. By developing new substrates for CB6 click that do not contain any cross-reactive functional groups and by optimizing reaction conditions, we converted CB6 click chemistry from a rotaxane synthesis tool into a useful bioconjugation technique. Using these new parameters, we synthesized a series of protein conjugates including protein-peptide, protein-DNA, protein-polymer, and protein-drug conjugates. We further demonstrated that CB6 click can be used in conjunction with strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to generate distinct bioconjugates in protein mixtures. CB6 click is a promising new reaction for the development of protein conjugates and can be applied toward the synthesis of complex biomaterials for a wide range of applications.",28650616,Cucurbit[6]uril-Promoted Click Chemistry for Protein Modification.,1,0

"Drug side effects are one of the public health concerns. Using powerful machine-learning methods to predict potential side effects before the drugs reach the clinical stages is of great importance to reduce time consumption and protect the security of patients. Recently, researchers have proved that the central nervous system (CNS) side effects of a drug are closely related to its permeability to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Inspired by this, we proposed an extended neighborhood-based recommendation method to predict CNS side effects using drug permeability to the BBB and other known features of drug. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict CNS side effects considering drug permeability to the BBB. Computational experiments demonstrated that drug permeability to the BBB is an important factor in CNS side effects prediction. Moreover, we built an ensemble recommendation model and obtained higher AUC score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AUPR score (area under the precision-recall curve) on the data set of CNS side effects by integrating various features of drug.",29058464,Prediction of Central Nervous System Side Effects Through Drug Permeability to Blood-Brain Barrier and Recommendation Algorithm.,0,1
"H1 nonsedating antihistamines, such as desloratadine, are first-line treatment options for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, desloratadine induces various degrees of sedation side effect in CSU patients, and no biomarkers currently exist for predicting the severity of such side effect. Herein, we evaluated the association between HRH1 gene rs901865 polymorphism and the severity of sedation side effect following desloratadine therapy in patients with CSU. We found that 20 of the 114 patients (17.50%) showed sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment, and 3 patients (2.63%) experienced serious sleepiness. The frequency of HRH1 rs901865 G allele was significantly higher in patients who experienced sedation than in patients with rs901865 A allele (p = 0.0009). Moreover, patients with the rs901865 G/G genotype suffered a more serious sedation side effect than patients with the rs901865 G/A genotype (p = 0.005). These results provide evidence that the HRH1 rs901865 G/G polymorphism is associated with severe sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment. Thus, the HRH1 rs901865 allele may potentially be used as a biomarker for predicting the severity of sedation side effect in patients suffering from CSU and treated with desloratadine.",31406237,Human H1 receptor (HRH1) gene polymorphism is associated with the severity of side effects after desloratadine treatment in Chinese patients with chronic spontaneous uticaria.,0,1

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the common causes of morbidity and mortality. Renal insufficiency is considered as one of the risk factors for the development of ADR. The study determined the occurrence of ADRs in patients with renal failure and their incidence of hospital admission. The study also evaluated the nature and severity of ADRs. This was a prospective study conducted in the nephrology unit at a tertiary care teaching hospital for a period of nine months. Patients receiving regular hemodialysis and those either referred or admitted to the nephrology ward were included. ADRs were intensively monitored throughout the study. The causality of suspected ADRs was assessed with the WHO probability scale, Naranjo algorithm, and Karch and Lasagna's scale. The predictability and preventability of ADRs were also determined. A total of 45 ADRs were identified in 369 patients; incidence was 12.19%. Nine ADRs (20%) needed hospitalization.

".Fluoroquinolones are a kind of synthetic drugs commonly used in clinical treatment. They have good broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are not only convenient to administer, but also have remarkable therapeutic effects. In this paper, we selected 70 patients with adverse reactions of central nervous system during the use of fluoroquinolones as the research object. We reviewed and analyzed the basic data, main manifestations and outcomes of adverse reactions, and summarized the influencing factors. The results showed that dizziness, irritability and insomnia were the main symptoms in 42 patients with mild adverse reactions. In 28 patients with moderate to severe adverse reactions, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as restlessness, depression, nervous excitation, phonism and hallucination were found. 54 patients were able to recover after stopping the medication. The remaining 16 patients were treated with drugs, and the effective rate was 87.5%. By analyzing the related factors, it can be seen that elderly patients over 60 years old, intravenous administration, combination of drugs and past history of neurological diseases are the main factors leading to adverse reactions of the central nervous system. In this survey, there were 7 kinds of adverse drug reactions, of which 31 cases (44.28%) were caused by levofloxacin. Therefore, fluoroquinolones have adverse effects on the central nervous system in the course of treatment, and the occurrence of adverse reactions is related to patients' age, route of administration, drug combination and past history of illness. It is important to grasp the above factors and make rational use of drugs.",30852480,Adverse reactions of fluoroquinolones to central nervous system and rational drug use in nursing care.,0,1

"The aim of this study was to assess an automated detection method of serious adverse reactions induced by oral targeted therapy (OTT) in patients with cancer, performed in the French Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) database. Patients with cancer of the Poitiers hospital who started an OTT between 2014 and 2015 were included. This study focused on adverse drug reaction which required inpatient hospitalization (ADR<sub>h</sub> ). All diagnoses coded in the DRG database for hospital stays that occurred within 3 months after OTT initiation were collected (potential ADR<sub>h</sub> ). Filters (exclusion criteria) were automatically applied on potential ADR<sub>h</sub> to exclude diagnoses that were not adverse drug reactions (false positives). A pharmacovigilance review was carried out to identify ADR<sub>h</sub> in the medical records (reported ADR<sub>h</sub> ). The sensitivity and specificity of the detection method were estimated for each filter combinations by comparison between potential and reported ADR<sub>h</sub> . This study included 129 patients. The medical records review led to identify 19 ADR<sub>h</sub> (all coded in the DRG database) in 14 patients. To maintain a 100% sensitivity of the method detection, the best specificity obtained was 58.3% (95% IC: [55.2-61.4]).The use of restrictive filters ('drug' in the diagnostic label, specific diagnosis code for adverse cancer drug reaction) resulted in a 97.8% specificity (95% IC: [96.6-98.5]) with a 38.2% sensitivity (95% IC: [23.9-55.0]). Our method has detected the third of ADR<sub>h</sub> with an excellent specificity.

"Cancer patients' quality of life is greatly dependent on the efficacy of treatments and their associated side effects, which can significantly reduce the overall quality of life. Although the effectiveness of cancer treatments has improved over time, adverse effects persist with each treatment. Some side effects, such as paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, can be dose limiting, thus further reducing the potential of paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment. Premature ovarian failure in young female patients due to radiation and chemotherapy therapy can have devastating infertility consequences. In recent years, a class of lipids known as sphingolipids has been identified as playing a role in the side effects of cancer therapies. Advanced analytical technologies, such as mass spectrometry, have provided great aid in detecting and distinguishing individual sphingolipids at low concentrations. Sphingolipids play an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and, importantly, sphingolipid metabolism has been shown to be dysregulated in cancer. The goal of this review is to summarize the latest findings of the role of sphingolipids in the injurious side effects in various cancer treatments. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these sphingolipid-induced side effects can help develop new drugs and treatments for cancer that have fewer side effects, thus improving treatment efficacy and quality of life.",30060816,Side Effects in Cancer Therapy: Are Sphingolipids to Blame?,0,1

"Controlled activation is a critical component in prodrug development. Here we report a concentration-sensitive platform approach for bioorthogonal prodrug activation by taking advantage of reaction kinetics. Using two 'click and release' systems, we demonstrate enrichment and prodrug activation specifically in mitochondria to demonstrate the principle of the approach. In both cases, the payload (doxorubicin or carbon monoxide) was released inside the mitochondrial matrix following the enrichment-initiated click reaction. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted delivery yielded substantial augmentation of functional biological and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo when compared to controls, which did not result in enrichment. This method is thus a platform for targeted drug delivery that is amenable to conjugation with a variety of molecules and is not limited to cell-surface delivery. Taken together, these two 'click and release' pairs clearly demonstrate the concept of enrichment-triggered drug release and the critical feasibility of treating clinically relevant diseases such as acute liver injury and cancer.",29760413,Enrichment-triggered prodrug activation demonstrated through mitochondria-targeted delivery of doxorubicin and carbon monoxide.,1,1
"Specific and targeted delivery of medical therapies continues to be a challenge for the optimal treatment of multiple medical conditions. Technological advances permit physicians to target most sites of the body. However, after the intervention, physicians rely on systemic medications that need frequent dosing and may have noxious side effects. A novel system combining the temporal flexibility of systemic drug delivery and the spatial control of injectable biomaterials would improve the spatiotemporal control of medical therapies. Here we present an implantable biomaterial that harnesses in vivo click chemistry to enhance the delivery of suitable small molecules by an order of magnitude. The results demonstrate a simple and modular method to modify a biomaterial with small molecules in vitro and present an example of a polysaccharide modified hours after in vivo implantation. This approach provides the ability to precisely control the moment when biochemical and/or physical signals may appear in an implanted biomaterial. This is the first step towards the construction of a biomaterial that enhances the spatial location of systemic small molecules via in vivo chemical delivery.

"Glycoproteins and their mimics are challenging to produce because of their large number of polysaccharide side chains that form a densely grafted protein-polysaccharide brush architecture.

Global amino acid substitution is used to replace the methionine residues in a methionine-enriched elastin-like polypeptide with homopropargylglycine (HPG); the substitution was found to replace 93% of the 41 methionines in the protein sequence as well as broaden and increase the thermoresponsive transition. A series of saccharides were conjugated to the recombinant protein backbones through copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition to determine reactivity trends, with 83-100% glycosylation of HPGs. Only an acetyl-protected sialyllactose moiety showed a lower level of 42% HPG glycosylation that is attributed to steric hindrance.

"<i>Giardia lamblia</i> is an important and ubiquitous cause of diarrheal disease. The primary agents in the treatment of giardiasis are nitroheterocyclic drugs, particularly the imidazoles metronidazole and tinidazole and the thiazole nitazoxanide. Although these drugs are generally effective, treatment failures occur in up to 20% of cases, and resistance has been demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> Prior work had suggested that side chain modifications of the imidazole core can lead to new effective 5-nitroimidazole drugs that can combat nitro drug resistance, but the full potential of nitroheterocycles other than imidazole to yield effective new antigiardial agents has not been explored. Here, we generated derivatives of two clinically utilized nitroheterocycles, nitrothiazole and nitrofuran, as well as a third heterocycle, nitropyrrole, which is related to nitroimidazole but has not been systematically investigated as an antimicrobial drug scaffold. Click chemistry was employed to synthesize 442 novel nitroheterocyclic compounds with extensive side chain modifications. Screening of this library against representative <i>G. lamblia</i> strains showed a wide spectrum of <i>in vitro</i> activities, with many of the compounds exhibiting superior activity relative to reference drugs and several showing >100-fold increase in potency and the ability to overcome existing forms of metronidazole resistance. The majority of new compounds displayed no cytotoxicity against human cells, and several compounds were orally active against murine giardiasis <i>in vivo</i> These findings provide additional impetus for the systematic development of nitroheterocyclic compounds with nonimidazole cores as alternative and improved agents for the treatment of giardiasis and potentially other infectious agents.",28396548,"Click Chemistry-Facilitated Structural Diversification of Nitrothiazoles, Nitrofurans, and Nitropyrroles Enhances Antimicrobial Activity against Giardia lamblia.",1,1
"The copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, a major click chemistry reaction, is widely employed in drug discovery and chemical biology. However, the success rate of the CuAAC reaction is not satisfactory as expected, and in order to improve its performance, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict its feasibility. First, we designed and synthesized a structurally diverse library of 700 compounds with the CuAAC reaction to obtain experimental data. Then, using reaction SMILES as input, we generated a bidirectional long-short-term memory with a self-attention mechanism (BiLSTM-SA) model. Our best prediction model has total accuracy of 80%. With the self-attention mechanism, adverse substructures responsible for negative reactions were recognized and derived as quantitative descriptors. Density functional theory investigations were conducted to provide evidence for the correlation between bromo-α-C hybrid types and the success rate of the reaction. Quantitative descriptors combined with RDKit descriptors were fed to three machine learning models, a support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression, and resulted in improved performance. The BiLSTM-SA model for predicting the feasibility of the CuAAC reaction is superior to other conventional learning methods and advances heuristic chemical rules.",32013419,Predicting the Feasibility of Copper(I)-Catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition Reactions Using a Recurrent Neural Network with a Self-Attention Mechanism.,1,1
"Recent findings suggest that dopamine oxidation contributes to the development of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the mechanistic details remain elusive. Here, we compare 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a product of dopamine oxidation that commonly induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in laboratory animals, with a synthetic alkyne-functionalized 6-OHDA variant. This synthetic molecule provides insights into the reactivity of quinone and neuromelanin formation. Employing Huisgen cycloaddition chemistry (or ""click chemistry"") and fluorescence imaging, we found that reactive 6-OHDA p-quinones cause widespread protein modification in isolated proteins, lysates and cells. We identified cysteine thiols as the target site and investigated the impact of proteome modification by quinones on cell viability. Mass spectrometry following cycloaddition chemistry produced a large number of 6-OHDA modified targets including proteins involved in redox regulation. Functional in vitro assays demonstrated that 6-OHDA inactivates protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is a central player in protein folding and redox homeostasis.

"Employment of polymeric nanomaterials in cancer therapeutics is actively pursued since they often enable drug administration with increased efficacy along with reduced toxic side effects. In this study, drug conjugated micellar constructs are fabricated using triblock dendron-linear polymer conjugates where a hydrophilic linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain is flanked by well-defined hydrophobic biodegradable polyester dendrons bearing an antiangiogenic drug, combretastatin-A4 (CA4). Variation in dendron generation is utilized to obtain a library of micellar constructs with varying sizes and drug loadings. In particular, a family of drug appended dendron-polymer conjugates based on polyester dendrons of generations ranging from G1 to G3 and 10 kDa linear PEG were obtained using [3 + 2] Huisgen type ""click"" chemistry. The final constructs benefit from PEG's hydrophilicity and antibiofouling character, as well as biodegradable nature of the hydrophobic polyester dendrons. The hydrophobic-hydrophilic-hydrophobic character of these constructs leads to the formation of flower-like micelles in aqueous media. In addition to generation-dependent subnanomolar range critical micelle concentrations, the resulting micelles possess hydrodynamic diameters suitable for passive tumor targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect; thereby they are suitable candidates as controlled drug delivery agents.

"Although platinum-based anticancer drugs prevail in cancer treatment, their clinical applications are limited by the severe side effects as well as their ineffectiveness against drug resistant cancers. A precise combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy can synergistically improve the therapeutic outcome and thereby may overcome drug resistance through a multipronged assault.

Using a copper-free click reaction, a targeting ligand is conjugated on the surface of the MNPs, aiming to specifically deliver a chemotherapeutic drug and a photosensitizer to cancer cells. Benefiting from the enhanced permeability and retention effect and active targeting capability, high tumor accumulation of MNPs is achieved, leading to an improved therapeutic outcome and reduced side effects.

"The recently developed synthetic oligonucleotides referred to as ""click"" nucleic acids (CNAs) are promising due to their relatively simple synthesis based on thiol-X reactions with numerous potential applications in biotechnology, biodetection, gene silencing, and drug delivery. Here, the cytocompatibility and cellular uptake of rhodamine tagged, PEGylated CNA copolymers (PEG-CNA-RHO) were evaluated. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells treated for 1 h with 1, 10, or 100 μg/mL PEG-CNA-RHO maintained an average cell viability of 86%, which was not significantly different from the untreated control. Cellular uptake of PEG-CNA-RHO was detected within 30 s, and the amount internalized increased over the course of 1 h. Moreover, these copolymers were internalized within cells to a higher degree than controls consisting of either rhodamine tagged PEG or the rhodamine alone. Uptake was not affected by temperature (i.e., 4 or 37 °C), suggesting a passive uptake mechanism. Subcellular colocalization analysis failed to indicate significant correlations between the internalized PEG-CNA-RHO and the organelles examined (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes and lysosomes). These results indicate that CNA copolymers are cytocompatible and are readily internalized by cells, supporting the idea that CNAs are a promising alternative to DNA in antisense therapy applications.",29698604,"Cytocompatibility and Cellular Internalization of PEGylated ""Clickable"" Nucleic Acid Oligomers.",1,1
"A facile reversed-phase microemulsion method was used to synthesize shell-core nanospheres of SiO<sub>2</sub>@RCs (SiO<sub>2</sub>-encapsuled rare-earth metal complexes). β-d-Galactose was then grafted onto the surfaces of the nanospheres through the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction for targeted delivery.

"Cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme is a promising anti-inflammatory drug target, and overexpression of this enzyme is also associated with several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

Herein, we describe the use of the cyclooxygenase-2 active site as a reaction vessel for the in situ generation of its own highly specific inhibitors. Multi-component competitive-binding studies confirmed that the cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme can judiciously select most appropriate chemical building blocks from a pool of chemicals to build its own highly potent inhibitor.

"PAK family kinases are RAC/CDC42-activated kinases that were first found in a soil amoeba 4 decades ago, and 2 decades later, were discovered in mammals as well. Since then at least 6 members of this family have been identified in mammals. One of them called PAK1 has been best studied so far, mainly because it is essential not only for malignant cell growth and metastasis, but also for many other diseases/disorders such as diabetes (type 2), AD (Alzheimer's disease), hypertension, and a variety of inflammatory or infectious diseases, which definitely shorten our lifespan. Moreover, PAK1-deficient mutant of C. elegans lives longer than the wild-type by 60%, clearly indicating that PAK1 is not only an oncogenic but also ageing kinase. Thus, in theory, both anti-oncogenic and longevity-promoting activities are among the ""intrinsic"" properties or criteria of ""clinically useful"" PAK1-blockers. There are a variety of PAK1-blocking natural products such as propolis and curcumin which indeed extend the healthy lifespan of small animals such as C. elegans by inducing the autophagy.

"Progress in genomics and proteomics attended to the door for better understanding the recent rapid expanding complex research field of metabolomics. This trend in biomedical research increasingly focuses to the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches with higher efficiency and sustainability. Simultaneously undesired adverse reactions are avoided. In parallel, the development of molecules for molecular imaging is required not only for the imaging of morphological structures but also for the imaging of metabolic processes like the aberrant expression of the cysteine protease cathepsin B (CtsB) gene and the activity of the resulting product associated with metastasis and invasiveness of malign tumors. Finally the objective is to merge imaging and therapy at the same level. The design of molecules which fulfil these responsibilities is pivotal and requires proper chemical methodologies. In this context our modified solid phase peptide chemistry using temperature shifts during synthesis is considered as an appropriate technology. We generated highly variable conjugates which consist of molecules useful as diagnostically and therapeutically active molecules. As an example the modular PNA products with the complementary sequence to the CtsB mRNA and additionally with a cathepsin B cleavage site had been prepared as functional modules for distinction of cell lines with different CtsB gene expression.

The alkyne-containing substituents are connected via a side chain position which projects away from the minor groove, and have only a small effect on DNA alkylation and cytotoxicity. The efficiency of click reactions with fluorophore azides was studied using alkylated ctDNA by analysing the adenine adducts produced after thermal depurination. Click reactions ""on DNA"" were sensitive to steric effects (tether length to the alkyne) and, surprisingly, to the nature of the fluorophore azide. With the best combination of click partners and reagents, adducts could be detected in the nuclei of treated cells by microscopy or flow cytometry, provided that an appropriate detergent (Triton X-100 and not Tween 20) was used for permeabilisation. The method is sensitive enough to detect adducts at physiologically relevant concentrations, and could have application in the development of nitro analogues of the duocarmycins as hypoxia-activated anticancer prodrugs.",25044224,Preparation and properties of clickable amino analogues of the duocarmycins: factors that affect the efficiency of their fluorescent labelling of DNA.,1,1

"Targeted delivery of therapeutics and diagnostics using nanotechnology holds great promise to minimize the side effects of conventional chemotherapy and enable specific and real-time detection of diseases.

It was found that the cleavage of PEG corona bearing a pH-sensitive benzoic-imine linkage (BPEG) could act as an on-off switch, which is capable of activating the clicked targeting ligands under extracellular acidic condition, followed by triggering the core degradation and payload release within tumor cells. In combination with superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPION) clustered within the micellar core, the MPUs exhibit excellent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast effects and T<sub>2</sub> relaxation in vitro, as well as magnetically guided MR imaging and multimodal targeting of therapeutics to tumor precisely, leading to significant inhibition of cancer with minimal side effect.

"The use of polymers as biomaterials has provided significant advantages in therapeutic applications. In particular, the possibility to modify and functionalize polymer chains with compounds that are able to improve biocompatibility, mechanical properties, or cell viability allows the design of novel materials to meet new challenges in the biomedical field. With the polymer functionalization strategies, click chemistry is a powerful tool to improve cell-compatibility and drug delivery properties of polymeric devices. Similarly, the fundamental need of biomedicine to use sterile tools to avoid potential adverse-side effects, such as toxicity or contamination of the biological environment, gives rise to increasing interest in the microwave-assisted strategy. The combination of click chemistry and the microwave-assisted method is suitable to produce biocompatible hydrogels with desired functionalities and improved performances in biomedical applications. This work aims to synthesize RGD-functionalized hydrogels. RGD (arginylglycylaspartic acid) is a tripeptide that can mimic cell adhesion proteins and bind to cell-surface receptors, creating a hospitable microenvironment for cells within the 3D polymeric network of the hydrogels. RGD functionalization occurs through Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Some PAA carboxyl groups are modified with an alkyne moiety, whereas RGD is functionalized with azido acid as the terminal residue of the peptide sequence. Finally, both products are used in a copper catalyzed click reaction to permanently link the peptide to PAA. This modified polymer is used with carbomer, agarose and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to synthesize a hydrogel matrix.

"Electro-click methodology was employed to prepare an electrochemical immunosensor for the cytokine interleukin 1β (IL-1β). The strategy involved binding of ethynylated IgG to azide-MWCNTs modified electrodes by Cu(I) catalyzed-cycloaddition reaction where the catalyst was electrochemically synthesized. This electro-click protocol is significantly faster and greener than the methods for catalyst generation through chemical reduction. The oriented immobilization of the capture antibody onto IgG-MWCNTs conjugates allowed the preparation of a sandwich-type immunosensor using biotinylated anti-IL-1β as detector antibody labeled with alkaline phosphatase-streptavidin (AP-strept). Differential pulse voltammetric transduction through the 1-naphthylphosphate/1-naphthol system was carried out. The analytical characteristics achieved with the electrochemical immunosensor showed a calibration curve exhibiting two linear ranges between 10 and 200 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.998), and from 200 to 1200 pg mL<sup>-1</sup> (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.998), and a LOD value of 5.2 pg mL<sup>-1</sup>, an improvement compared with those claimed for commercial ELISA kits. In addition, the assay time was at least one hour shorter. Excellent performance was observed in the determination of IL-1β in saliva with no need for sample treatment, and by simple interpolation using a calibration plot constructed with standard solutions of the target cytokine.",32087557,Design of electrochemical immunosensors using electro-click chemistry.

"The misreplication of damaged DNA, a biological process termed translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), produces a large number of adverse effects on human health. This chapter describes the application of an artificial nucleoside/nucleotide system that functions as a biochemical probe to quantify TLS activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. For in vitro studies, the artificial nucleotide, 3-ethynyl-5-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxyriboside triphosphate (3-Eth-5-NITP), is used as it is efficiently inserted opposite an abasic site, a highly pro-mutagenic DNA lesion produced by several types of DNA-damaging agents. The placement of the ethynyl moiety allows the incorporated nucleoside triphosphate to be selectively tagged with azide-containing fluorophores via ""click"" chemistry. This reaction provides a facile way to quantify the extent of nucleotide incorporation opposite this and other noninstructional DNA lesions. The corresponding nucleoside, 3-Eth-5-NIdR, can be used to monitor TLS activity in hematological and adherent cancer cells treated with compounds that produce noninstructional DNA lesions. As described above, visualizing the replication of these lesions is achieved using copper-catalyzed ""click"" chemistry to tag the ethynyl moiety present on the nucleotide with fluorogenic probes. This technique represents a new diagnostic approach to quantify TLS activity inside cells. In addition, the application of this ""clickable"" nucleoside provides a chemical probe to identify cells that become drug resistant by the facile replication of noninstructional DNA lesions produced by DNA-damaging agents.",31016706,Artificial Nucleosides as Diagnostic Probes to Measure Translesion DNA Synthesis.,0,0

"Current methods for bioconjugation rely on the introduction of stable linkers that lack the required versatility to perform sequential functionalizations. However, sequential manipulations are an increasing requirement in chemical biology because they can underpin multiple analyses of the same sample to provide a wider understanding of cell behavior. Here, we present a new method to site-selectively <i>write</i>, <i>remove</i>, and <i>rewrite</i> chemical functionality to a biomolecule, DNA in this case. Our method combines the precision and robustness of methyltransferase-directed labeling with the reversibility of acyl hydrazones and the efficiency of click chemistry. Underpinning the method is a new <i>S</i>-adenosyl-l-methionine derivative to site-selectively label DNA with a bifunctional chemical handle containing an acyl hydrazone-linker and a terminal azide. Functional <i>tags</i> are conjugated via the azide and can be <i>removed (i.e., untagged)</i> when needed at the acyl hydrazone via exchange with hydroxyl amine. The formed hydrazide-labeled DNA is a versatile intermediate that can be either <i>rewritten</i> to reset the original chemical handle or covalently reacted with a <i>permanent tag</i>. This ability to <i>write</i>, <i>tag</i>, <i>untag</i>, and <i>permanently tag</i> DNA is exploited to sequentially introduce two fluorescent dyes on DNA. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of the method by developing a protocol to sort labeled DNA using magnetic beads, with subsequent amplification of the sorted DNA sample for further analysis. The presented method opens new avenues for site-selective bioconjugation and should underpin integrative approaches in chemical biology where sequential functionalizations of the same sample are required.",32342002,"Site-Selective and Rewritable Labeling of DNA through Enzymatic, Reversible, and Click Chemistries.",0,0
"Intramolecular click-chemistry is increasingly used to generate and control the architecture of complex macromolecules including peptides. Such compounds are, however, very challenging to analyze, in particular quantitatively and also to assess their purity. In this study, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) experiments were carried out with an ion trap mass spectrometer using the Survival Yield (SY) technique to analyze several mixtures of protonated, alkali and alkaline earth metal complexes of two topological linear and cyclic peptide isomers. Univariate (using a single excitation voltage) and multivariate (using several excitation voltages) calibration models have been used. The sensitivity, linearity (R<sup>2</sup>), intermediate precision (s<sub>Int</sub>) and error of predicted values (RMSEP) of external calibrations curves have been compared leading to the conclusions that: 1) quantification using tandem mass spectrometry can be performed, with very good performances, for such peptides despite isomerism, 2) quantification is also possible despite the absence of diagnostic fragment ions (possibly independently of the amino-acid sequence), 3) best results are obtained with the largest alkali cation, Cs<sup>+</sup>, while protonation is highly discouraged, 4) uni/multivariate models show similar performances, but the univariate model may be more suitable for potential applications with direct infusion by electrospray ionization (ESI-MS/MS) and/or matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI-MS/MS).

"Identification of various factors involved in adverse drug reactions in target proteins to develop therapeutic drugs with minimal/no side effect is very important. In this context, we have performed a comparative evolutionary rate analyses between the genes exhibiting drug side-effect(s) (SET) and genes showing no side effect (NSET) with an aim to increase the prediction accuracy of SET/NSET proteins using evolutionary rate determinants. We found that SET proteins are more conserved than the NSET proteins. The rates of evolution between SET and NSET protein primarily depend upon their noncomplex (protein complex association number = 0) forming nature, phylogenetic age, multifunctionality, membrane localization, and transmembrane helix content irrespective of their essentiality, total druggability (total number of drugs/target), m-RNA expression level, and tissue expression breadth. We also introduced two novel terms-killer druggability (number of drugs with killing side effect(s)/target), essential druggability (number of drugs targeting essential proteins/target) to explain the evolutionary rate variation between SET and NSET proteins. Interestingly, we noticed that SET proteins are younger than NSET proteins and multifunctional younger SET proteins are candidates of acquiring killing side effects. We provide evidence that higher killer druggability, multifunctionality, and transmembrane helices support the conservation of SET proteins over NSET proteins in spite of their recent origin. By employing all these entities, our Support Vector Machine model predicts human SET/NSET proteins to a high degree of accuracy (∼86%).",28391292,Systematic Analyses and Prediction of Human Drug Side Effect Associated Proteins from the Perspective of Protein Evolution.,0,0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are reshaping the prognosis of many cancer and are progressively becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many tumour types. Immunotherapy is bringing new hope to patients, but also a whole new spectrum of toxicities for healthcare practitioners to manage. Oncologists and specialists involved in the pluridisciplinary management of patients with cancer are increasingly confronted with the therapeutic challenge of treating patients with severe and refractory immune-related adverse events. In this Personal View, we summarise the therapeutic strategies that have been used to manage such toxicities resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. On the basis of current knowledge about their pathogenesis, we discuss the use of new biological and non-biological immunosuppressive drugs to treat severe and steroid refractory immune-related adverse events. Depending on the immune infiltrate type that is predominant, we propose a treatment algorithm for personalised management that goes beyond typical corticosteroid use. We propose a so-called shut-off strategy that aims at inhibiting key inflammatory components involved in the pathophysiological processes of immune-related adverse events, and limits potential adverse effects of drug immunosuppression on tumour response. This approach develops on current guidelines and challenges the step-by-step increase approach to drug immunosuppression.",30614479,New therapeutic perspectives to manage refractory immune checkpoint-related toxicities.,0,0
"Adverse event report (AER) data are a key source of signal for post marketing drug surveillance. The standard methodology to analyze AER data applies disproportionality metrics, which estimate the strength of drug/side-effect associations from discrete counts of their occurrence at report level. However, in other domains, improvements in predictive modeling accuracy have been obtained through representation learning, where discrete features are replaced by distributed representations learned from unlabeled data. This paper describes aer2vec, a novel representational approach for AER data in which concept embeddings emerge from neural networks trained to predict drug/side-effect co-occurrence. Trained models are evaluated for their utility in identifying drug/side-effect relationships, with improvements over disproportionality metrics in most cases. In addition, we evaluate the utility of an otherwise-untapped resource in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) AER system - reporter designations of suspected causality - and find that incorporating this information enhances performance of all models evaluated.",32308867,<i>aer2vec</i>: Distributed Representations of Adverse Event Reporting System Data as a Means to Identify Drug/Side-Effect Associations.,0,0
"<b>Background:</b> More than 1.3 million emergency department visits have been associated with adverse drug events (ADEs) in older adults. Increasing Alzheimer's disease (AD) prevalence in the geriatric population poses an additive risk of ADEs because of the array of psychotropic medications prescribed for AD patients. Scant research has been conducted at a nationwide level on psychotropic-related ADEs in this population. <b>Objective:</b> This study aimed to determine the incidence and economic burden of psychotropic ADEs in the geriatric AD population compared with the non-AD geriatric population. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis was conducted of geriatric AD patients who visited the ED in 2013 with a psychotropic-related ADE to determine the incidence and resource utilization of these events. The relationship between presence of AD and an ADE was analyzed using multiple logistic regression. <b>Results:</b> There were 427 969 Alzheimer's ED visits compared with 20 492 554 ED visits without. Of the AD cases, 1.04% were associated with at least 1 adverse event. AD cases more frequently were admitted as inpatients (64.90% vs 34.92%, <i>P</i> < 0.01). Common drug classes associated with AD-related ADEs were benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and autonomic nervous system-affecting agents (adrenergic agonists, antimuscarinic agents, anticholinergic agents). There was a significantly higher likelihood for Alzheimer's cases to experience any psychotropic-related adverse event (OR = 1.66; 95% CI = 1.20, 1.82). <b>Conclusion and Relevance:</b> Alzheimer's patients more frequently experienced psychotropic-related adverse events and related adverse outcomes than older adults without Alzheimer's. Application of these findings should be implemented in protocol development to reduce future psychotropic-related adverse outcomes for this population.",31342766,"Emergency Department Visits for Psychotropic-Related Adverse Drug Events in Older Adults With Alzheimer Disease, 2013-2014.",0,0

The dendrimers of G1 and G2 in particular showed the largest affinity for the proteins. The addition of the sulfonated GlcNAc dendrimers of G1 and G2 exhibited an inhibition effect on the aggregation of the amyloid beta peptide, reduced the b-sheet conformation, and led to a reduction in the level of nanofiber formation.",23047486,Syntheses of sulfo-glycodendrimers using click chemistry and their biological evaluation.,0,0
"Background Pharmacovigilance, as it is carried out primarily by healthcare professionals is more focused on being very objective in nature. Acknowledging the importance of the subjective experience of patients in pharmacovigilance was underpinned by its unique ability to bring about a more holistic understanding through the deep information unraveled by the patients. Medication safety-related information has to be shared with patients to allow them to be actively involved in their therapy and pharmacovigilance. Despite the advantages of sharing information, it stands to reasons whether sharing information related to possible side effects would negatively affect patients and impinge upon their treatment plan and process. Aim of the Review The purpose of this systematic review was to critically assess the potential negative impact of informing patients about medication side effects by written and/or oral information on medication compliance, occurrence/development of suspected side effects and clinical outcomes. Method A comprehensive search was conducted in PubMed, and Cochrane library to identify potential records between the year 1975 and 2017; then titles, abstracts, and full texts were screened using the inclusion criteria to filter out irrelevant studies. The data extraction, and the results were narratively synthesized and presented in tables. Results A total of 2012 articles were screened for inclusion, 32 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility and finally resulting in the inclusion of 17 randomized control studies which met the set criteria. Findings unraveled that the educational intervention did not result in increased occurrence/reporting of side effects in most of the evaluated studies; except 4 studies, and no significant impact on compliance to medications and negative clinical outcome was observed. Apprehension of negative events to medications were observed in two of the four studies which evaluated these parameters. Conclusion The present review did not find enough evidence to support the over concerns on the potential negative impact of sharing of information on the adverse effects to patients, though the influence could manifest as nocebo-effect. The various components and methods employed for this information sharing process can influence the potential impact of this activity. These concerns about the undesirable effects should not deter the active involvement of patients in pharmacovigilance activities. There is a definite need to have more studies in this area, where much of concern still does exist among the various stakeholders of drug safety information.",30136054,Potential negative impact of informing patients about medication side effects: a systematic review.,0,0
"Computational drug target prediction has become an important process in drug discovery. Network-based approaches are commonly used in computational drug-target interaction (DTI) prediction. Existing network-based approaches are limited in capturing the contextual information on how diseases, drugs and genes are connected. Here, we proposed a context-sensitive network (CSN) model for DTI prediction by modeling contextual drug phenotypic relationships. We constructed a Drug-Side Effect Context-Sensitive Network (DSE-CSN) of 139 760 drug-side effect pairs, representing 1480 drugs and 5868 side effects. We also built a protein-protein interaction network (PPIN) of 15 267 gene nodes and 178 972 weighted edges. A heterogeneous network was built by connecting the DSE-CSN and the PPIN through 3684 known DTIs. For each drug on the DSE-CSN, its genetic targets were predicted and prioritized using a network-based ranking algorithm. Our approach was evaluated in both de novo and leave-one-out cross-validation analysis using known DTIs as the gold standard. We compared our DSE-CSN-based model to the traditional similarity-based network (SBN)-based prediction model. The results suggested that the DSE-CSN-based model was able to rank known DTIs highly. In a de novo cross-validation, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was 0.95. In a leave-one-out cross-validation, the average rank was top 3.2% for known DTIs. When it was compared to the SBN-based model using the Precision-Recall curve, our CSN-based model achieved a higher mean average precision (MAP) (0.23 versus 0.19, P-value<1e-4) in a de novo cross-validation analysis. We further improved the CSN-based DTI prediction by differentially weighting the drug-side effect pairs on the network and showed a significant improvement of the MAP (0.29 versus 0.23, P-value<1e-4). We also showed that the CSN-based model consistently achieved better performances than the traditional SBN-based model across different drug classes. Moreover, we demonstrated that our novel DTI predictions can be supported by published literature. In summary, the CSN-based model, by modeling the context-specific inter-relationships among drugs and side effects, has a high potential in drug target prediction.",30428013,A Drug-Side Effect Context-Sensitive Network approach for drug target prediction.,0,0

"Drug toxicity evaluation is an essential process of drug development as it is reportedly responsible for the attrition of approximately 30% of drug candidates. The rapid increase in the number and types of large toxicology data sets together with the advances in computational methods may be used to improve many steps in drug safety evaluation. The development of in silico models to screen and understand mechanisms of drug toxicity may be particularly beneficial in the early stages of drug development where early toxicity assessment can most reduce expenses and labor time. To facilitate this, machine learning methods have been employed to evaluate drug toxicity but are often limited by small and less diverse data sets. Recent advances in machine learning methods together with the rapid increase in big toxicity data such as molecular descriptors, toxicogenomics, and high-throughput bioactivity data may help alleviate some of the current challenges. In this article, the most common machine learning methods used in toxicity assessment are reviewed together with examples of toxicity studies that have used machine learning methodology.
