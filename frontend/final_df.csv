"Antiseizure drugs (ASDs) are known to cause a wide range of adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Recently, electronic health care data using the common data model (CDM) have been introduced and commonly adopted in pharmacovigilance research. We aimed to analyze ASD-related ADRs using CDM and to assess the feasibility of CDM analysis in monitoring ADR in a single tertiary hospital.",32162687,Analysis of antiseizure drug-related adverse reactions from the electronic health record using the common data model.,1,0
"The results of national safety studies are essential for decision-making at the regulatory level and have also educational implications for prescribing patterns. The aim of this study was to analyze the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of analgesic medicines spontaneously reported to Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Service of the Romanian National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices between 2011 and 2015. For the 71 reports, patients had a mean age of 39.8 years; 60.6% of patients were female, and 38% male and 1.4% were unknown. Reporters were mainly physicians (74.7%), and 52.1% of ADR reports were transmitted through marketing authorization holders. Of the serious ADRs (32.4%), 34.7% led to hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. The most frequent ADRs reported were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (25.8%) and general disorders and administration site conditions (19.2%). Metamizole, alone or in combination, was the main analgesic suspected in almost 15.5% of the cases and remains one of the most popular analgesics in Romania. Ten cases were assessed as preventable or potentially preventable (14%), of which two cases were serious. Even if the level of reporting is still low, this study conducted on ADRs of analgesics reported to the national pharmacovigilance center represents an essential step toward promoting the rational use of analgesics in Romania.",29314262,Adverse drug reactions of analgesic medicines: analysis of the Romanian pharmacovigilance database.,1,0
"The epidemiological data are limited for the spontaneous adverse drug reaction (ADR) reporting system in psychiatry and its comparison with intensive monitoring studies in terms of causative drugs, seriousness, preventability and drug interactions. This spontaneous ADR reporting study was carried out over a period of three years in the psychiatry department. We adopted WHO definition for an ADR, Naranjo's algorithm for causality, WHO-ADR terminology for the labeling of involved organ-system, International conference on harmonisation (ICH) E2A guidelines for seriousness, modified Schumock and Thornton's criteria for preventability and Medscape drug interaction checker for drug interactions. Two subgroup analyses were performed to find out the risk factors for the serious and preventable reactions. A total of 97 ADRs from 67 patients were included for analysis. The incidence of 'overall' and 'serious ADRs were 0.69% (95% CI: 0.54%, 0.88%) and 0.18% (95% CI: 0.12-0.29%), respectively. The females experienced more ADRs than males. The most commonly reported ADR, incriminated pharmacology group and drug, were extrapyramidal movement disorders (22.68%), atypical antipsychotics (35.62%) and escitalopram (13.91%), respectively. One out of five and one out three reactions were considered as 'serious' and 'preventable', respectively. The drug interactions contributed in 34.02% reactions. The factors significantly associated with 'serious' reactions were typical antipsychotics [OR: 5.47 (1.68, 17.87)], central and peripheral nervous system disorders [OR: 24.00 (5.12, 112.5)] and extrapyramidal reactions [OR: 14.03 (4.43, 44.43)]. The polypharmacy [OR: 5.85 (1.90, 18.03)] was significantly associated with 'preventable' reactions. The spontaneous reporting system is efficient to detect serious reactions and preventable reactions.

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are common and important complications of drug therapy for children. The risk for ADRs changes over childhood, as do the nature and types of ADRs. Importantly, the risk and nature of ADRs in children are markedly different from those of adults, and adult data cannot be relied on to guide safe drug therapy in children. There are groups of children, notably those with complex and chronic diseases, who are at substantial risk for ADRs. The evaluation of an undesired effect during therapy is ideally accomplished by an organized approach that is a skill that clinicians who care for children-especially those children at high risk for ADRs must have. Additionally, clinicians as well as drug regulatory agencies and industry need to be both vigilant and astute as well as aware that ADRs in children are often different in nature and frequency from those in adults. The increasing use of pharmacogenomics to guide drug dosing and the increasing number of biological agents will provide new sets of challenges to clinicians over the next decade.",30248196,"Adverse Drug Reactions Across the Age Continuum: Epidemiology, Diagnostic Challenges, Prevention, and Treatments.",1,0
"<b>Objective:</b> Cardiovascular disease (CVD) drugs have been frequently implicated in adverse drug reaction (ADR)-related hospitalizations. Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are common preventable cause of ADRs, but the impact of DDIs in the CVD population has not been investigated. Hence, the primary aim of the study was to identify DDIs associated with ADRs in CVD patients at hospital admission. The second aim was to develop a simple tool to identify high-risk patients for DDI-related adverse events. <b>Methods:</b> An observational study was conducted on the Cardiology Ward of University Clinical Hospital Center. Data were obtained from medical charts. A clinical panel identified DDIs implicated in ADRs, using LexiInteract database and Drug Interaction Probability Scale. Statistics were performed using PASW 22 (SPSS Inc.). <b>Results:</b> DDIs contributed to hospital admission with a total prevalence of 9.69%. DDI-related ADRs affected mainly cardiac function (heart rate or rhythm, 41.07%); bleeding and effect on blood pressure were equally distributed (17.86%). Non-cardiovascular ADRs were found in 23.21% of DDIs. After admission, 73% of the identified DDIs led to changes in prescription. Prediction ability of calculated DDI adverse event probability scores was rated as good (AUC = 0.80, <i>p</i> < .001). <b>Conclusions:</b> CVD patients are highly exposed to adverse DDIs; about one in ten patients hospitalized with CVD might have a DDI contributing to the hospitalization. Given the high prevalence of CVD, DDI-related harm might be a significant burden worldwide. Identification of patients with high DDI adverse event risk might ease the recognition of DDI-related harm and improve the use of electronic databases in clinical practice.",31328967,Adverse drug reactions caused by drug-drug interactions in cardiovascular disease patients: introduction of a simple prediction tool using electronic screening database items.,1,0

"<b>Background</b> There are different treatment options for ocular toxoplasmosis (OT). ""Classic"" therapy consists of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine and folinic acid combined with systemic steroids and is still widely used. However, potentially severe side effects of this therapy have been reported. The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the incidence and types of adverse drug reactions in patients treated for OT. Clinical management of each adverse drug reaction was assessed. <b>Patients and Methods</b> In this retrospective analysis, we reviewed data of patients with OT, who were consecutively examined between December 2011 and December 2015 at the Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital Zurich. <b>Results</b> In total, 49 patients had at least one episode of active OT. In 54 (83.0 %) of 65 treated episodes, the classic regimen was used. Of the 37 patients who received classic treatment, 9 (24.3 %) developed at least one adverse drug reaction which led to drug discontinuation, including elevated creatinine (5.4 %), elevated liver enzymes (5.4 %), vomiting (5.4 %), rash (5.4 %) and facial swelling (2.7 %). In 5 patients, treatment was switched to another drug, while in the other 4 patients, therapy was stopped. In these 9 patients, inflammation was well controlled 8 weeks after onset of therapy. No patient suffered from severe side effects, such as potentially life-threatening allergic reactions or pancytopenia. <b>Conclusions</b> In OT patients who were treated with classic therapy, adverse drug reactions are common. Therefore, clinical and laboratory monitoring is mandatory. Adverse drug reactions may require interdisciplinary management.",28329892,Ocular Toxoplasmosis: Therapy-Related Adverse Drug Reactions and Their Management.,1,0

".Fluoroquinolones are a kind of synthetic drugs commonly used in clinical treatment. They have good broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are not only convenient to administer, but also have remarkable therapeutic effects. In this paper, we selected 70 patients with adverse reactions of central nervous system during the use of fluoroquinolones as the research object. We reviewed and analyzed the basic data, main manifestations and outcomes of adverse reactions, and summarized the influencing factors. The results showed that dizziness, irritability and insomnia were the main symptoms in 42 patients with mild adverse reactions. In 28 patients with moderate to severe adverse reactions, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as restlessness, depression, nervous excitation, phonism and hallucination were found. 54 patients were able to recover after stopping the medication. The remaining 16 patients were treated with drugs, and the effective rate was 87.5%. By analyzing the related factors, it can be seen that elderly patients over 60 years old, intravenous administration, combination of drugs and past history of neurological diseases are the main factors leading to adverse reactions of the central nervous system. In this survey, there were 7 kinds of adverse drug reactions, of which 31 cases (44.28%) were caused by levofloxacin. Therefore, fluoroquinolones have adverse effects on the central nervous system in the course of treatment, and the occurrence of adverse reactions is related to patients' age, route of administration, drug combination and past history of illness. It is important to grasp the above factors and make rational use of drugs.",30852480,Adverse reactions of fluoroquinolones to central nervous system and rational drug use in nursing care.,1,0

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the common causes of morbidity and mortality. Renal insufficiency is considered as one of the risk factors for the development of ADR. The study determined the occurrence of ADRs in patients with renal failure and their incidence of hospital admission. The study also evaluated the nature and severity of ADRs. This was a prospective study conducted in the nephrology unit at a tertiary care teaching hospital for a period of nine months. Patients receiving regular hemodialysis and those either referred or admitted to the nephrology ward were included. ADRs were intensively monitored throughout the study. The causality of suspected ADRs was assessed with the WHO probability scale, Naranjo algorithm, and Karch and Lasagna's scale. The predictability and preventability of ADRs were also determined. A total of 45 ADRs were identified in 369 patients; incidence was 12.19%. Nine ADRs (20%) needed hospitalization. A total of 27 (60%) and 17 (37.8%) ADRs were found to be probable and possible, respectively when assessed by the WHO probability scale. On the contrary, 33 (73.3%) and 26 (57.8%) ADRs were possible in causality when assessed by Karch and Lasagna's scale and Naranjo scale, respectively. Most of the ADRs [26 (57.8%)] were predictable in nature.

"Targeted anticancer drugs such as imatinib, trastuzumab and erlotinib dramatically improved treatment outcomes in cancer patients, however, these innovative agents are often associated with unexpected side effects. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these side effects are not well understood. The availability of a comprehensive knowledge base of side effects associated with targeted anticancer drugs has the potential to illuminate complex pathways underlying toxicities induced by these innovative drugs. While side effect association knowledge for targeted drugs exists in multiple heterogeneous data sources, published full-text oncological articles represent an important source of pivotal, investigational, and even failed trials in a variety of patient populations. In this study, we present an automatic process to extract targeted anticancer drug-associated side effects (drug-SE pairs) from a large number of high profile full-text oncological articles. We downloaded 13,855 full-text articles from the Journal of Oncology (JCO) published between 1983 and 2013. We developed text classification, relationship extraction, signaling filtering, and signal prioritization algorithms to extract drug-SE pairs from downloaded articles. We extracted a total of 26,264 drug-SE pairs with an average precision of 0.405, a recall of 0.899, and an F1 score of 0.465. We show that side effect knowledge from JCO articles is largely complementary to that from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) drug labels. Through integrative correlation analysis, we show that targeted drug-associated side effects positively correlate with their gene targets and disease indications. In conclusion, this unique database that we built from a large number of high-profile oncological articles could facilitate the development of computational models to understand toxic effects associated with targeted anticancer drugs.

"An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. ADRs are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and increase health costs. The pharmacovigilance systems allow the identification and prevention of the risks associated with use of a drug, especially of recently marketed drugs; they detect signals from data of the global ADR register and also support decisions taken by regulatory agencies in different countries. Only a few drugs are withdrawn from the market, mainly due to hepatotoxicity. Spontaneous notification of ADR is the cheapest, simplest and most used method to recognize new safety drug problems, under-reporting being its main limitation. The future of pharmacovigilance and ADRs will include a higher involvement of patients, doctors, health authorities and pharmaceutical companies, and the use of new technologies.",31771857,Adverse drug reactions.,1,0

"Perampanel (PER) is a new-generation antiepileptic drug that has an occasional but significant shortcoming, psychiatric adverse effects (PAEs). Recently, antiepileptic drug-related adverse reactions, such as skin rash and even PAEs, have been discovered to be correlated with certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) types. Thus, we aimed to analyze specific HLA alleles as risk factors for PER-PAEs. We prospectively enrolled 17 patients with epilepsy who were prescribed PER between May 2016 and Jul 2018 at Seoul National University Hospital and developed PAEs while taking PER. Their HLA types were analyzed compared to those of 19 patients in the PAE-tolerant group and the general Korean population. In silico docking was performed with two different computational programs, AutoDock Vina and SwissDock, to theoretically evaluate the binding affinity of PER in the grooves of the specific HLA alleles. The HLA-DQB1*06:01, DRB1*08:03, and B*54:01 alleles were significantly associated with the patients who developed PER-PAEs compared with the general Korean population (odds ratio [OR] 3.94, p = 0.008, OR 9.24, p = 0.037, and OR 3.25, p = 0.041, respectively). As a haplotype, the combination of the three alleles was significantly more frequent in the PER-PAE group than in both the PER-tolerant group and the general Korean population. DQB1*06:01 and B*54:01 also demonstrated higher docking scores with PER than other alleles. This is the first study to analyze the association of PER-PAEs with specific HLA genotypes. Our results suggest that an HLA-associated genetic predisposition and a possible immunological mechanism are involved in the occurrence of PER-PAEs.",32788606,HLAs associated with perampanel-induced psychiatric adverse effects in a Korean population.,1,0

"Maternal diabetes can lead to pregnancy complications and impaired fetal development. The goal of this study was to use a mouse model of reciprocal embryo transfer to distinguish between the preconception and gestational effects of diabetes. To induce diabetes female mice were injected with a single high dose of streptozotocin and 3 weeks thereafter used as oocyte donors for in vitro fertilization (IVF) and as recipients for embryo transfer. Following IVF embryos were cultured to the blastocyst stage in vitro or transferred to diabetic and non-diabetic recipients. Diabetic and non-diabetic females did not differ in regard to the number of oocytes obtained after ovarian stimulation, oocytes ability to become fertilized, and embryo development in vitro. However, diabetic females displayed impaired responsiveness to superovulation. Reciprocal embryo transfer resulted in similar incidence of live fetuses and abortions, and no changes in placental size. However, fetuses carried by diabetic recipients were smaller compared to those carried by non-diabetic recipients, regardless hyperglycemia status of oocyte donors. Congenital abnormalities were observed only among the fetuses carried by diabetic recipients. The findings support that the diabetic status during pregnancy, and not the preconception effect of diabetes on oogenesis, leads to fetal growth restriction and congenital deformities.",32703993,"Pregnancy environment, and not preconception, leads to fetal growth restriction and congenital abnormalities associated with diabetes.",0,1

"Human pesticide exposure can occur both occupationally and environmentally during manufacture and after the application of indoor and outdoor pesticides, as well as through consumption via residues in food and water. There is evidence from experimental studies that numerous pesticides, either in isolation or in combination, act as endocrine disruptors, neurodevelopmental toxicants, immunotoxicants, and carcinogens. We reviewed the international literature on this subject for the years between 1990 and 2017. The studies were considered in this review through MEDLINE and WHO resources. Out of the n = 1817 studies identified, n = 94 were reviewed because they fulfilled criteria of validity and addressed associations of interest. Epidemiological studies have provided limited evidence linking pre- and post-natal exposure to pesticides with cancers in childhood, neurological deficits, fetal death, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, and congenital abnormalities (CAs). In this review, the potential association between pesticide exposure and the appearance of some human CAs (including among others musculoskeletal abnormalities; neural tube defects; urogenital and cardiovascular abnormalities) was investigated. A trend towards a positive association between environmental or occupational exposure to some pesticides and some CAs was detected, but this association remains to be substantiated. Main limitations of the review include inadequate exposure assessment and limited sample size. Adequately powered studies with precise exposure assessments such as biomonitoring, are warranted to clarify with certainty the potential association between pesticide exposure and human CAs.",29596925,Association of pesticide exposure with human congenital abnormalities.,0,1

"Here we report the first male case of a novel Xq22.1 deletion. An 8-week-old boy with multiple congenital abnormalities and respiratory failure was referred to the Mayo Clinic Cytogenetics laboratory for testing. Chromosomal microarray analysis identified a novel 1.1 Mb deletion at Xq22.1. A similar deletion has only been described once in the literature in a female patient and her mother; both have intellectual disability and dysmorphic facial features. In addition, the mother had a son who died at 15 days due to breathing failure. Recently, a mouse model revealed that a 0.35 Mb sub-region, containing 4 genes, is sufficient to cause majority of the Xq22.1 deletion phenotypes. The deleted intervals in our male patient and the female patients contain 15 common genes, including the four described in the 0.35 Mb sub-region. Male mice with deletion of the 0.35 Mb sub-region died perinatally from respiratory failure due to pulmonary hypoplasia, consistent with the breathing problem and potential neonatal fatality in male patients. The phenotypes of the mouse models and the patients are strikingly similar; therefore, the deletion of these five genes (ARMCX5, ARMCX5-GPRASP2, GPRASP1, GPRASP2, and BHLHB9) is likely responsible for the novel Xq22.1 deletion syndrome.

"Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) and familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) are known to predispose to hepatoblastoma (HB). A case-control study was conducted through the Children's Oncology Group (COG) to study the association of HB with isolated congenital abnormalities.

Data on congenital abnormalities among subjects and covariates were obtained by maternal telephone interview. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) describing the association between congenital abnormalities with HB, adjusted for sex, birth weight, maternal age and maternal education, were calculated using unconditional logistic regression. There was a significant association of HB with kidney, bladder, or sex organ abnormalities (OR = 4.75; 95% CI: 1.74-13) which appeared to be specific to kidney/bladder defects (OR = 4.3; 95% CI: 1.2-15.3) but not those of sex organs (OR = 1.24; 95% CI: 0.37-4.1).

"Numerous drugs have the potential to prolong the QT interval and may cause accidental cardiac arrest (torsades de pointes [TdP]). Women are at a higher risk than men for experiencing drug-induced TdP. Due to the lack of appropriate tools, few studies have investigated whether genetic differences between men and women have any effects on drug-induced proarrhythmia. Sex hormones are believed to play a predominant role in the induction of TdP. Recently, progress in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technologies has made it possible to utilize human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) to investigate the influence of both genetics and sex hormones on cardiac ion channel gene expression and cardiomyocyte function. In this study, we investigated genetic and hormonal effects on sex differences of drug-induced QT prolongation and TdP with hiPSC-CMs from healthy male and female donors. We found that despite batch variations in beating rates and field potential durations (FPD), female-derived hiPSC-CMs showed steeper slopes of FPD to interspike interval ratios and were more sensitive to IKr blocker-induced FPD prolongation. 17β-estradiol increased FPD and 5α-dihydrotestosterone shortened FPD, but the addition of sex hormones had limited effect on the responses of hiPSC-CMs to IKr blockades. The differential expression of KCNE1 gene and reduced repolarization reserve in female-derived hiPSC-CMs compared with male-derived hiPSC-CMs may partially explain why females are more susceptible to proarrhythmias. Human iPSC-CMs can be a useful new model to study mechanisms of sex differences in cardiomyocyte repolarization processes and aid in the prediction of drug-induced proarrhythmias in both men and women.",30247688,Sex-Related Differences in Drug-Induced QT Prolongation and Torsades de Pointes: A New Model System with Human iPSC-CMs.,1,1

"The antiretroviral drug lopinavir/ritonavir has been recently repurposed for the treatment of COVID-19. Its empirical use has been associated with multiple cardiac adverse reactions pertaining to its ancillary multi-channel blocking properties, vaguely characterized until now. We aimed to characterize qualitatively the cardiotoxicity associated with lopinavir/ritonavir in the setting of COVID-19. Spontaneous notifications of cardiac adverse drug reactions reported to the national Pharmacovigilance Network were collected for 8 weeks since March 1st 2020. The Nice Regional Center of Pharmacovigilance, whose scope of expertise is drug-induced long QT syndrome, analyzed the cases, including the reassessment of all available ECGs. QTc ≥ 500 ms and delta QTc > 60 ms from baseline were deemed serious. Twenty-two cases presented with 28 cardiac adverse reactions associated with the empirical use of lopinavir/ritonavir in a hospital setting. Most adverse reactions reflected lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block voltage-gated potassium channels with 5 ventricular arrhythmias and 17 QTc prolongations. An average QTc augmentation of 97 ± 69 ms was reported. Twelve QTc prolongations were deemed serious. Other cases were likely related to lopinavir/ritonavir potency to block sodium channels: 1 case of bundle branch block and 5 recurrent bradycardias. The incidence of cardiac adverse reactions of lopinavir/ritonavir was estimated between 0.3% and 0.4%. These cardiac adverse drug reactions offer a new insight in its ancillary multi-channel blocking functions.

"Background Citalopram and escitalopram can both induce dose-dependent QT prolongation. The risk of arrhythmia may be increased with concomitant use of other drugs that induce QT prolongation. Objective To evaluate the prevalence and impact of pharmacist interventions on the combination of citalopram or escitalopram with other drugs that induce QT prolongation. Setting A French hospital with 517 computerized beds. Method All cardiac adverse drug reactions (ADRs) related to citalopram or escitalopram reported to the French pharmacovigilance database (FPDB) were analyzed. Then, over a 6-month period, all computerized prescriptions including citalopram or escitalopram and drug-drug interactions (DDI) were analyzed by pharmacists using a computerized provider order entry system (DXCare<sup>®</sup>, Medasys). Results Only 27 cardiac ADRs related to citalopram or escitalopram were reported in the database. Among the 57,857 prescriptions and 2116 contraindicated DDIs (3.7 %) that were analyzed. 444 DDIs (0.8 %) were considered to be clinically relevant by pharmacists and physicians and 168 (i.e., approximately 30 %) were related to a combination including citalopram or escitalopram. Most of the prescriptions related to DDIs including citalopram or escitalopram were discontinued in response to a pharmacist intervention when initiated during the hospital stay.

"Cardiac repolarization abnormalities can be caused by a wide range of cardiac and non-cardiac compounds and may lead to the development of life-threatening Torsades de Pointes (TdP) ventricular arrhythmias. Drug-induced torsades de pointes is associated with unexpected and unexplained sudden cardiac deaths resulting in the withdrawal of several compounds in the past. To better understand the mechanism of such unexpected sudden cardiac deaths, the concept of repolarization reserve has recently emerged. According to this concept, pharmacological, congenital or acquired impairment of one type of transmembrane ion channel does not necessarily result in excessive repolarization changes because other repolarizing currents can take over and compensate. In this review, the major factors contributing to repolarization reserve are discussed in the context of their clinical significance in physiological and pathophysiological conditions including drug administration, genetic defects, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, gender, renal failure, hypokalaemia, hypothyroidism and athletes' sudden deaths. In addition, pharmacological support of repolarization reserve as a possible therapeutic option is discussed. Some methods for the quantitative estimation of repolarization reserve are also recommended. It is concluded that repolarization reserve should be considered by safety pharmacologists to better understand, predict and prevent previously unexplained drug-induced sudden cardiac deaths.",21545574,Cardiac ventricular repolarization reserve: a principle for understanding drug-related proarrhythmic risk.,1,1
"In vitro human ether-à-go-go related gene (hERG) inhibition assay alone might provide insufficient information to discriminate ""safe"" from ""dangerous"" drugs. Here, effects of multichannel inhibition on cardiac electrophysiology were investigated using a family of cardiac cell models (Purkinje (P), endocardial (Endo), mid-myocardial (M) and epicardial (Epi)). We found that: (1) QT prolongation alone might not necessarily lead to early afterdepolarization (EAD) events, and it might be insufficient to predict arrhythmogenic liability; (2) the occurrence and onset of EAD events could be a candidate biomarker of drug-induced arrhythmogenicity; (3) M cells are more vulnerable to drug-induced arrhythmias, and can develop early afterdepolarization (EAD) at slower pacing rates; (4) the application of quinidine can cause EADs in all cell types, while I<sub>NaL</sub> is the major depolarizing current during the generation of drug-induced EAD in P cells, I<sub>CaL</sub> is mostly responsible in other cell types; (5) drug-induced action potential (AP) alternans with beat-to-beat variations occur at high pacing rates in P cells. These results suggested that quantitative profiling of transmural and rate-dependent properties can be essential to evaluate drug-induced arrhythmogenic risks, and may provide mechanistic insights into drug-induced arrhythmias.",31811197,Transmural and rate-dependent profiling of drug-induced arrhythmogenic risks through in silico simulations of multichannel pharmacology.,0,0

"<b>Introduction</b>: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of differentiating into all types of cells in the body and so provide suitable toxicology screening systems even for hard-to-obtain human tissues. Since hPSCs can also be generated from differentiated cells and current gene editing technologies allow targeted genome modifications, hPSCs can be applied for drug toxicity screening both in normal and disease-specific models. Targeted hPSC differentiation is still a challenge but cardiac, neuronal or liver cells, and complex cellular models are already available for practical applications. <b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review new gene-editing and cell-biology technologies to generate sensitive toxicity screening systems based on hPSCs. Then the authors present the use of undifferentiated hPSCs for examining embryonic toxicity and discuss drug screening possibilities in hPSC-derived models. The authors focus on the application of human cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cultures in toxicity testing, and discuss the recent possibilities for drug screening in a 'body-on-a-chip' model system. <b>Expert opinion</b>: hPSCs and their genetically engineered derivatives provide new possibilities to investigate drug toxicity in human tissues.
