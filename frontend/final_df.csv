"Renal patients have a high incidence of adverse drug reactions due to both pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes and detecting these adverse drug reactions relies heavily on having a high index of suspicion-which seems to be invoked through experience, whether our own or that of our colleagues. Pharmacists must be vigilant about adverse drug reactions and it is vital that pharmacists continue to teach their colleagues about their experiences identifying less common adverse drug reactions and adverse drug reactions with unusual presentations in addition to simply reporting these adverse drug reactions.",29855988,The role of the suspicious renal pharmacist in identifying unusual adverse drug reactions-why this is not a small problem.,1,0
"An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as a response to a medicinal product which is noxious and unintended. ADRs are an important cause of morbidity and mortality and increase health costs. The pharmacovigilance systems allow the identification and prevention of the risks associated with use of a drug, especially of recently marketed drugs; they detect signals from data of the global ADR register and also support decisions taken by regulatory agencies in different countries. Only a few drugs are withdrawn from the market, mainly due to hepatotoxicity. Spontaneous notification of ADR is the cheapest, simplest and most used method to recognize new safety drug problems, under-reporting being its main limitation. The future of pharmacovigilance and ADRs will include a higher involvement of patients, doctors, health authorities and pharmaceutical companies, and the use of new technologies.",31771857,Adverse drug reactions.,1,0

"The results of national safety studies are essential for decision-making at the regulatory level and have also educational implications for prescribing patterns. The aim of this study was to analyze the adverse drug reactions (ADRs) of analgesic medicines spontaneously reported to Pharmacovigilance and Risk Management Service of the Romanian National Agency for Medicines and Medical Devices between 2011 and 2015. For the 71 reports, patients had a mean age of 39.8 years; 60.6% of patients were female, and 38% male and 1.4% were unknown. Reporters were mainly physicians (74.7%), and 52.1% of ADR reports were transmitted through marketing authorization holders. Of the serious ADRs (32.4%), 34.7% led to hospitalization or prolonged hospitalization. The most frequent ADRs reported were skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (25.8%) and general disorders and administration site conditions (19.2%). Metamizole, alone or in combination, was the main analgesic suspected in almost 15.5% of the cases and remains one of the most popular analgesics in Romania. Ten cases were assessed as preventable or potentially preventable (14%), of which two cases were serious. Even if the level of reporting is still low, this study conducted on ADRs of analgesics reported to the national pharmacovigilance center represents an essential step toward promoting the rational use of analgesics in Romania.",29314262,Adverse drug reactions of analgesic medicines: analysis of the Romanian pharmacovigilance database.,1,0
"Drug side effects are one of the public health concerns. Using powerful machine-learning methods to predict potential side effects before the drugs reach the clinical stages is of great importance to reduce time consumption and protect the security of patients. Recently, researchers have proved that the central nervous system (CNS) side effects of a drug are closely related to its permeability to the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Inspired by this, we proposed an extended neighborhood-based recommendation method to predict CNS side effects using drug permeability to the BBB and other known features of drug. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to predict CNS side effects considering drug permeability to the BBB. Computational experiments demonstrated that drug permeability to the BBB is an important factor in CNS side effects prediction. Moreover, we built an ensemble recommendation model and obtained higher AUC score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) and AUPR score (area under the precision-recall curve) on the data set of CNS side effects by integrating various features of drug.",29058464,Prediction of Central Nervous System Side Effects Through Drug Permeability to Blood-Brain Barrier and Recommendation Algorithm.,1,0
"H1 nonsedating antihistamines, such as desloratadine, are first-line treatment options for chronic spontaneous urticaria (CSU). However, desloratadine induces various degrees of sedation side effect in CSU patients, and no biomarkers currently exist for predicting the severity of such side effect. Herein, we evaluated the association between HRH1 gene rs901865 polymorphism and the severity of sedation side effect following desloratadine therapy in patients with CSU. We found that 20 of the 114 patients (17.50%) showed sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment, and 3 patients (2.63%) experienced serious sleepiness. The frequency of HRH1 rs901865 G allele was significantly higher in patients who experienced sedation than in patients with rs901865 A allele (p = 0.0009). Moreover, patients with the rs901865 G/G genotype suffered a more serious sedation side effect than patients with the rs901865 G/A genotype (p = 0.005). These results provide evidence that the HRH1 rs901865 G/G polymorphism is associated with severe sedation side effect after desloratadine treatment. Thus, the HRH1 rs901865 allele may potentially be used as a biomarker for predicting the severity of sedation side effect in patients suffering from CSU and treated with desloratadine.",31406237,Human H1 receptor (HRH1) gene polymorphism is associated with the severity of side effects after desloratadine treatment in Chinese patients with chronic spontaneous uticaria.,1,0

"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the common causes of morbidity and mortality. Renal insufficiency is considered as one of the risk factors for the development of ADR. The study determined the occurrence of ADRs in patients with renal failure and their incidence of hospital admission. The study also evaluated the nature and severity of ADRs. This was a prospective study conducted in the nephrology unit at a tertiary care teaching hospital for a period of nine months. Patients receiving regular hemodialysis and those either referred or admitted to the nephrology ward were included. ADRs were intensively monitored throughout the study. The causality of suspected ADRs was assessed with the WHO probability scale, Naranjo algorithm, and Karch and Lasagna's scale. The predictability and preventability of ADRs were also determined. A total of 45 ADRs were identified in 369 patients; incidence was 12.19%. Nine ADRs (20%) needed hospitalization. A total of 27 (60%) and 17 (37.8%) ADRs were found to be probable and possible, respectively when assessed by the WHO probability scale. On the contrary, 33 (73.3%) and 26 (57.8%) ADRs were possible in causality when assessed by Karch and Lasagna's scale and Naranjo scale, respectively. Most of the ADRs [26 (57.8%)] were predictable in nature. A wide range of ADRs was noticed in patients with renal impairment, and our study has systematically assessed the nature and severity of ADRs.",31696846,Intensive monitoring of adverse drug reactions in nephrology unit of tertiary care teaching hospital.,1,0
"The law requires that healthcare professionals adequately inform patients about possible side effects when they prescribe new pharmacological treatments. There are several reasons (lack of time, fear of nocebo effect, patient and prescriber preferences) why informing patients in detail could be undesirable or even harmful. Prescribers should focus on two types of side effects: (a) common side effects with significant impact on the quality of life and (b) side effects that should be recognised in time to prevent further harm. During treatment, patients should be monitored regularly for efficacy and side effects in order to weigh benefits and risks and to stop or switch therapy when necessary.",32757513,[Which side effects should I inform patients about?],1,0
".Fluoroquinolones are a kind of synthetic drugs commonly used in clinical treatment. They have good broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties. They are not only convenient to administer, but also have remarkable therapeutic effects. In this paper, we selected 70 patients with adverse reactions of central nervous system during the use of fluoroquinolones as the research object. We reviewed and analyzed the basic data, main manifestations and outcomes of adverse reactions, and summarized the influencing factors. The results showed that dizziness, irritability and insomnia were the main symptoms in 42 patients with mild adverse reactions. In 28 patients with moderate to severe adverse reactions, neuropsychiatric symptoms such as restlessness, depression, nervous excitation, phonism and hallucination were found. 54 patients were able to recover after stopping the medication. The remaining 16 patients were treated with drugs, and the effective rate was 87.5%. By analyzing the related factors, it can be seen that elderly patients over 60 years old, intravenous administration, combination of drugs and past history of neurological diseases are the main factors leading to adverse reactions of the central nervous system. In this survey, there were 7 kinds of adverse drug reactions, of which 31 cases (44.28%) were caused by levofloxacin. Therefore, fluoroquinolones have adverse effects on the central nervous system in the course of treatment, and the occurrence of adverse reactions is related to patients' age, route of administration, drug combination and past history of illness. It is important to grasp the above factors and make rational use of drugs.",30852480,Adverse reactions of fluoroquinolones to central nervous system and rational drug use in nursing care.,1,0

"The aim of this study was to assess an automated detection method of serious adverse reactions induced by oral targeted therapy (OTT) in patients with cancer, performed in the French Diagnosis Related Groups (DRG) database. Patients with cancer of the Poitiers hospital who started an OTT between 2014 and 2015 were included. This study focused on adverse drug reaction which required inpatient hospitalization (ADR<sub>h</sub> ). All diagnoses coded in the DRG database for hospital stays that occurred within 3 months after OTT initiation were collected (potential ADR<sub>h</sub> ). Filters (exclusion criteria) were automatically applied on potential ADR<sub>h</sub> to exclude diagnoses that were not adverse drug reactions (false positives). A pharmacovigilance review was carried out to identify ADR<sub>h</sub> in the medical records (reported ADR<sub>h</sub> ). The sensitivity and specificity of the detection method were estimated for each filter combinations by comparison between potential and reported ADR<sub>h</sub> . This study included 129 patients. The medical records review led to identify 19 ADR<sub>h</sub> (all coded in the DRG database) in 14 patients. To maintain a 100% sensitivity of the method detection, the best specificity obtained was 58.3% (95% IC: [55.2-61.4]).The use of restrictive filters ('drug' in the diagnostic label, specific diagnosis code for adverse cancer drug reaction) resulted in a 97.8% specificity (95% IC: [96.6-98.5]) with a 38.2% sensitivity (95% IC: [23.9-55.0]). Our method has detected the third of ADR<sub>h</sub> with an excellent specificity.

"Cancer patients' quality of life is greatly dependent on the efficacy of treatments and their associated side effects, which can significantly reduce the overall quality of life. Although the effectiveness of cancer treatments has improved over time, adverse effects persist with each treatment. Some side effects, such as paclitaxel-induced peripheral neuropathy, can be dose limiting, thus further reducing the potential of paclitaxel chemotherapy treatment. Premature ovarian failure in young female patients due to radiation and chemotherapy therapy can have devastating infertility consequences. In recent years, a class of lipids known as sphingolipids has been identified as playing a role in the side effects of cancer therapies. Advanced analytical technologies, such as mass spectrometry, have provided great aid in detecting and distinguishing individual sphingolipids at low concentrations. Sphingolipids play an important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis and, importantly, sphingolipid metabolism has been shown to be dysregulated in cancer. The goal of this review is to summarize the latest findings of the role of sphingolipids in the injurious side effects in various cancer treatments. A better understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving these sphingolipid-induced side effects can help develop new drugs and treatments for cancer that have fewer side effects, thus improving treatment efficacy and quality of life.",30060816,Side Effects in Cancer Therapy: Are Sphingolipids to Blame?,1,0

"Patients education about chemotherapy and its side effects is important. The health-related distress among the patients can be decreased by promoting self-care behaviors. A cross-sectional study was conducted at the King Abdul-Aziz University Hospital with 90 patients from the hospital's oncology department in Jeddah during the period between December 2015 and January 2016. The study was performed by using a self-administered questionnaire among the sample of the study. Eight percent (n = 33) patients scored higher knowledge regarding chemotherapy and its side effects, while 11.1% (n = 8) had low knowledge. Moreover, 36.1% (n = 26) of patients reported complete compliance with the self-care behaviors to manage chemotherapy side effects, 43.1% (n = 31) reported partial compliance, and 20.8% (n = 15) reported less compliance. Physicians were reported as main source of information by 80.6% (n = 58) of their patients.

"Click chemistry refers to a group of reactions that are fast, simple to use, easy to purify, versatile, regiospecific, and give high product yields. Therefore, a novel, efficient magnetic nano-sorbent based on N-methyl-D-glucamine attached to magnetic nanoparticles was prepared using click coupling method. Its boron sorption capacity was compared with N-methyl-D-glucamine direct attached nano-sorbent. The characterization of the magnetic sorbents was investigated by several techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, dynamic light scattering, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier transform infrared spectrophotometer, and vibrating sample magnetometer. The boron sorption capacity of sorbents was compared by studying various essential factors influencing the sorption, like sorbate concentration, sorbents dosage, pH of the solution, and contact time. Langmuir and Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich adsorption isotherms models were applied. Percent removal and sorption capacities efficiencies of sorbents obtained with direct and click coupling are found to be 49.5%, 98.7% and 6.68 mg/g, 13.44 mg/g respectively. Both sorbents have been found to be compatible with Langmuir isotherm, and the boron sorption kinetics conforms to the pseudo second order kinetics.

"Click chemistry is an immensely powerful technique for the fast and efficient covalent conjugation of molecular entities. Its broad scope has positively impacted on multiple scientific disciplines, and its implementation within the nucleic acid field has enabled researchers to generate a wide variety of tools with application in biology, biochemistry, and biotechnology. Azide-alkyne cycloadditions (AAC) are still the leading technology among click reactions due to the facile modification and incorporation of azide and alkyne groups within biological scaffolds. Application of AAC chemistry to nucleic acids allows labeling, ligation, and cyclization of oligonucleotides efficiently and cost-effectively relative to previously used chemical and enzymatic techniques. In this review, we provide a guide to inexperienced and knowledgeable researchers approaching the field of click chemistry with nucleic acids.

"A one-bead one-compound (OBOC) library of peptide-based imaging agents was developed where a <sup>19</sup>F-containing moiety was added onto the N-terminus of octamer peptides through copper-free click chemistry prior to screening of the library. This created a library of complete imaging agents that was screened against CXCR4, a receptor of interest for cancer imaging. The screen directly resulted in the discovery of a peptide-based imaging agent with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 138 μM.

"The development of new bio-orthogonal ligation methods for the conjugation of native proteins is of particular importance in the field of chemical biology and biotherapies. In this work, we developed a traceless electrochemical method for protein bioconjugation. The electrochemically promoted tyrosine-click (e-Y-CLICK) allowed the chemoselective Y-modification of peptides and proteins with labeled urazoles. A low potential is applied in an electrochemical cell to activate urazole anchors in situ and on demand, without affecting the electroactive amino acids from the protein. The versatility of the electrosynthetic approach was shown on biologically relevant peptides and proteins such as oxytocin, angiotensin 2, serum bovine albumin, and epratuzumab. The fully conserved enzymatic activity of a glucose oxidase observed after e-Y-CLICK further highlights the softness of the method. The e-Y-CLICK protocols were successfully performed in pure aqueous buffers, without the need for co-solvents, scavenger or oxidizing chemicals, and should therefore significantly broaden the scope of bioconjugation.",30422648,Electrochemically Promoted Tyrosine-Click-Chemistry for Protein Labeling.,0,1
"HIV-1 RT has been considered as one of the most important targets for the development of anti-HIV-1 drugs for their well-solved three-dimensional structure and well-known mechanism of action. In this study, with HIV-1 RT as target, we used miniaturized parallel click chemistry synthesis via CuAAC reaction followed by in situ biological screening to discover novel potent HIV-1 NNRTIs. A 156 triazole-containing inhibitor library was assembled in microtiter plates and in millimolar scale. The enzyme inhibition screening results showed that 22 compounds exhibited improved inhibitory activity.

The molecular simulation analysis suggested that the hydrogen bonding interactions of A3N19 with the main chain of Lys101 and Lys104 was responsible for its potency. Overall, the results indicated the in situ click chemistry-based strategy was rational and might be amenable for the future discovery of more potent HIV-1 NNRTIs.",32200201,In situ click chemistry-based rapid discovery of novel HIV-1 NNRTIs by exploiting the hydrophobic channel and tolerant regions of NNIBP.,0,1
"Surface modifications with tethered growth factors have mainly been applied to synthetic polymeric biomaterials in well-controlled, acellular settings, followed by seeding with cells. The known bio-orthogonality of copper-free click chemistry provides an opportunity to not only use it in vitro to create scaffolds or pro-migratory tracks in the presence of living cells, but also potentially apply it to living tissues directly as a coupling modality in situ. In this study, we studied the chemical coupling of growth factors to collagen using biocompatible copper-free click chemistry and its effect on the enhancement of growth factor activity in vitro. We verified the characteristics of modified epidermal growth factor (EGF) using mass spectrometry and an EGF/EGF receptor binding assay, and evaluated the chemical immobilization of EGF on collagen by copper-free click chemistry using surface X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), surface plasmon resonance (SPR) spectroscopy, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). We found that the anchoring was noncytotoxic, biocompatible, and rapid. Moreover, the surface-immobilized EGF had significant effects on epithelial cell attachment and proliferation. Our results demonstrate the possibility of copper-free click chemistry as a tool for covalent bonding of growth factors to collagen in the presence of living cells. This approach is a novel and potentially clinically useful application of copper-free click chemistry as a way of anchoring growth factors to collagen and foster epithelial wound healing.",28598594,Tethering Growth Factors to Collagen Surfaces Using Copper-Free Click Chemistry: Surface Characterization and in Vitro Biological Response.,0,1
"A click reaction is reported here for the first time as a useful technique to control the conformational stability of natural organic matter (NOM) suprastructures. Click conjugates were successfully formed between a previously butynylated NOM hydrophobic fraction and a hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG)-amino chain. The click products were shown by size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC) hyphenated with Orbitrap mass spectrometry (MS) in electrospray ionization (ESI) (+), while precursors were visible in ESI (-). Despite their increase in molecular weight, HPSEC elution of click conjugates occurred after that of precursors, thus showing their departure from the NOM supramolecular association. This indicates that the click-conjugated NOM molecules were varied in their hydrophilic and cationic character and lost the capacity to accommodate in the original hydrophobic suprastructures. The most abundant product had the C16H30O5N4 formula, a click conjugate of butanoic acid, while other products were short-chained (C4-C8) linear unsaturated and hydroxylated carboxylic acids. Tandem MS revealed formation of triazole rings in clicked conjugates and their two fragmentations at the ester and the C-N alkyl-aryl bonds. The behavior of NOM molecules modified by click chemistry confirms that hydrophobicity and ionic charge of humic molecules play a pivotal role in stabilizing intermolecular forces in NOM. Moreover, the versatility of the click reaction may become useful to decorate NOM molecules with a variety of substrates, in order to alter NOM conformational and chemical properties and diversify its applications in the environment.

"Bacterial infections pose mounting public health concerns and cause an enormous medical and financial burden today. Rapid and sensitive detection of pathogenic bacteria at the point of care (POC) remains a paramount challenge. Here, we report a novel concept of bacteria-instructed click chemistry and employ it for POC microbial sensing. In this concept of bacteria-instructed click chemistry, we demonstrate for the first time that pathogenic bacteria can capture and reduce exogenous Cu<sup>2+</sup> to Cu<sup>+</sup> by leveraging their unique metabolic processes. The produced Cu<sup>+</sup> subsequently acts as a catalyst to trigger the click reaction between gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) modified with azide and alkyne functional molecules, resulting in the aggregation of nanoparticles with a color change of the solution from red to blue. In this process, signal amplification from click chemistry is complied with the aggregation of functionalized AuNPs, thus presenting a robust colorimetric strategy for sensitive POC sensing of pathogenic bacteria. Notably, this colorimetric strategy is easily integrated in a smartphone app as a portable platform to achieve one-click detection in a mobile way. Moreover, with the help of the magnetic preseparation process, this smartphone app-assisted platform enables rapid (within 1 h) detection of Escherichia coli with high sensitivity (40 colony-forming units/mL) in the complex artificial sepsis blood samples, showing great potential for clinical early diagnosis of bacterial infections.",31184853,Bacteria-Instructed Click Chemistry between Functionalized Gold Nanoparticles for Point-of-Care Microbial Detection.,0,1
"The advent of click chemistry has had a profound influence on almost all branches of chemical science. This is particularly true of radiochemistry and the synthesis of agents for positron emission tomography (PET), single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), and targeted radiotherapy. The selectivity, ease, rapidity, and modularity of click ligations make them nearly ideally suited for the construction of radiotracers, a process that often involves working with biomolecules in aqueous conditions with inexorably decaying radioisotopes. In the following pages, our goal is to provide a broad overview of the first 10 years of research at the intersection of click chemistry and radiochemistry. The discussion will focus on four areas that we believe underscore the critical advantages provided by click chemistry: (i) the use of prosthetic groups for radiolabeling reactions, (ii) the creation of coordination scaffolds for radiometals, (iii) the site-specific radiolabeling of proteins and peptides, and (iv) the development of strategies for in vivo pretargeting.

"Metabolic sugar labeling followed by the use of reagent-free click chemistry is an established technique for in vitro cell targeting. However, selective metabolic labeling of the target tissues in vivo remains a challenge to overcome, which has prohibited the use of this technique for targeted in vivo applications. Herein, we report the use of targeted ultrasound pulses to induce the release of tetraacetyl N-azidoacetylmannosamine (Ac4 ManAz) from microbubbles (MBs) and its metabolic expression in the cancer area. Ac4 ManAz-loaded MBs showed great stability under physiological conditions, but rapidly collapsed in the presence of tumor-localized ultrasound pulses. The released Ac4 ManAz from MBs was able to label 4T1 tumor cells with azido groups and significantly improved the tumor accumulation of dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)-Cy5 by subsequent click chemistry. We demonstrated for the first time that Ac4 ManAz-loaded MBs coupled with the use of targeted ultrasound could be a simple but powerful tool for in vivo cancer-selective labeling and targeted cancer therapies.",27010510,Targeted Ultrasound-Assisted Cancer-Selective Chemical Labeling and Subsequent Cancer Imaging using Click Chemistry.,0,1
"Metabolic glycoengineering is a powerful technique that can introduce various chemical groups to cellular glycan by treatment of unnatural monosaccharide. Particularly, this technique has enabled many challenging trials for molecular imaging in combination with click chemistry, which provides fast and specific chemical conjugation reaction of imaging probes to metabolically-modified live cells. This review introduces recent progress in molecular imaging based on the combination of these two cutting-edge techniques. First, these techniques showed promising results in specific tumor cell imaging for cancer diagnosis and therapy. The related researches showed the surface of tumor cells could be labeled with bioorthogonal chemical groups by metabolic glycoengineering, which can be further conjugated with fluorescence dyes or nanoparticles with imaging probes by click chemistry, in vitro and in vivo. This method can be applied to heterogeneous tumor cells regardless of genetic properties of different tumor cells. Furthermore, the amount of targeting moieties on tumor cells can be freely controlled externally by treatment of unnatural monosaccharide. Second, this sequential use of metabolic glycoengineering and click chemistry is also useful in cell tracking to monitor the localization of the inoculated therapeutic cells including chondrocytes and stem cells. This therapeutic cell-labeling technique provided excellent viability of chondrocytes and stem cells during the whole process in vitro and in vivo. It can provide long-term and safe therapeutic cell imaging compared to traditional methods. These overall studies demonstrate the great potential of metabolic glycoengineering and click chemistry in live cell imaging.",28399460,Molecular imaging based on metabolic glycoengineering and bioorthogonal click chemistry.,0,1
"Cell division cycle 25 (Cdc25) protein phosphatases play key roles in the transition between the cell cycle phases and their association with various cancers has been widely proven, which makes them ideal targets for anti-cancer treatment. Though several Cdc25 inhibitors have been developed, most of them displayed low activity and poor subtype selectivity. Therefore, it is extremely important to discover novel small molecule inhibitors with potent activities and significant selectivity for Cdc25 subtypes, not only served as drugs to treat cancer but also to probe its mechanism in transitions. In this study, miniaturized parallel click chemistry synthesis via CuAAC reaction followed by in situ biological screening were used to discover selective Cdc25 inhibitors. The bioassay results showed that compound M2N12 proved to be the most potent Cdc25 inhibitor, which also act as a highly selective Cdc25C inhibitor and was about 9-fold potent than that of NSC 663284. Moreover, M2N12 showed remarkable anti-growth activity against the KB-VIN cell line, equivalent to that of PXL and NSC 663284. An all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach was further employed to probe the significant selectivity of M2N12 for Cdc25C relative to its structural homologs Cdc25A and Cdc25B. Overall, above results make M2N12 a promising lead compound for further investigation and structural modification.",31541869,Identification of highly potent and selective Cdc25 protein phosphatases inhibitors from miniaturization click-chemistry-based combinatorial libraries.,0,1
"Albumin is one of the most attractive nanoplatforms for targeted imaging and drug delivery due to its biocompatibility and long circulation half-life. However, previously reported albumin-based nanoplatforms have shown inconsistent blood circulation half-life according to the modified methods, and the affecting factors were not well evaluated, which could hamper the clinical translation of albumin-based nanoplatforms. Herein, we developed a finely tuned click-chemistry based albumin nanoplatform (CAN) with a longer circulation half-life and an efficient tumor targeting ability. <b>Methods:</b> CAN was synthesized in two steps. First, albumin was conjugated with ADIBO-NHS (albumin-ADIBO) by reacting albumin with various molar ratios of ADIBO. The number of attached ADIBO moieties was determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). Second, the desired modalities including azide-functionalized chelator, a fluorescence dye, and folate were incorporated into albumin-ADIBO using strain-promoted alkyne-azide cycloaddition reaction (SPAAC reaction). The biodistribution and targeting efficiency of functionalized CANs were demonstrated in mice. <b>Results:</b> The degree of functionalization (DOF) and resulting <i>in vivo</i> biodistribution was controlled precisely using the click chemistry approach. Specifically, the numbers of attached azadibenzocyclooctyne (ADIBO) moieties on albumin, the DOF, were optimized by reacting albumin with varying molar ratios of ADIBO with a high reproducibility. Furthermore, we developed a simple and efficient method to estimate the DOF using <i>UV</i>-<i>visible</i> spectrophotometry (UV-vis), which was further validated by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight (MALDI-TOF). The biodistribution of CAN could be controlled by DOF, and CAN with an optimized DOF showed a long circulation half-life (> 18 h). CAN was further functionalized using a simple click chemistry reaction with an azide functionalized chelator, a fluorescence dye, and folate. <sup>64</sup>Cu- and folate-labeled CAN (<sup>64</sup>Cu-CAN-FA) showed effective and specific folate receptor targeting <i>in vivo</i>, with an over two-fold higher uptake than the liver at 24 h post-injection. <b>Conclusions:</b> Our development from the precisely controlled DOF demonstrates that an optimized CAN can be used as a multifunctional nanoplatform to obtain a longer half-life with radioisotopes and ligands, and provides an effective method for the development of albumin-based tumor theranostic agents.",31281486,Versatile and Finely Tuned Albumin Nanoplatform based on Click Chemistry.,0,1
"Azide-alkyne cycloaddition is a powerful reaction for the formation of bioconjugates. When catalyzed by Cu(I) or strain promotion, this cycloaddition is considered to be a ""click"" reaction with many applications in chemical biology and materials science. We report a new type of azide-alkyne click chemistry for the synthesis of protein conjugates using cucurbit[6]uril (CB6) supramolecular chemistry. CB6-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition has been previously used for the synthesis of rotaxanes but has not been applied to the development of complex bioconjugates. By developing new substrates for CB6 click that do not contain any cross-reactive functional groups and by optimizing reaction conditions, we converted CB6 click chemistry from a rotaxane synthesis tool into a useful bioconjugation technique. Using these new parameters, we synthesized a series of protein conjugates including protein-peptide, protein-DNA, protein-polymer, and protein-drug conjugates. We further demonstrated that CB6 click can be used in conjunction with strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition to generate distinct bioconjugates in protein mixtures. CB6 click is a promising new reaction for the development of protein conjugates and can be applied toward the synthesis of complex biomaterials for a wide range of applications.",28650616,Cucurbit[6]uril-Promoted Click Chemistry for Protein Modification.,0,1

"Controlled activation is a critical component in prodrug development. Here we report a concentration-sensitive platform approach for bioorthogonal prodrug activation by taking advantage of reaction kinetics. Using two 'click and release' systems, we demonstrate enrichment and prodrug activation specifically in mitochondria to demonstrate the principle of the approach. In both cases, the payload (doxorubicin or carbon monoxide) was released inside the mitochondrial matrix following the enrichment-initiated click reaction. Furthermore, mitochondria-targeted delivery yielded substantial augmentation of functional biological and therapeutic effects in vitro and in vivo when compared to controls, which did not result in enrichment. This method is thus a platform for targeted drug delivery that is amenable to conjugation with a variety of molecules and is not limited to cell-surface delivery. Taken together, these two 'click and release' pairs clearly demonstrate the concept of enrichment-triggered drug release and the critical feasibility of treating clinically relevant diseases such as acute liver injury and cancer.",29760413,Enrichment-triggered prodrug activation demonstrated through mitochondria-targeted delivery of doxorubicin and carbon monoxide.,1,1
"Specific and targeted delivery of medical therapies continues to be a challenge for the optimal treatment of multiple medical conditions. Technological advances permit physicians to target most sites of the body. However, after the intervention, physicians rely on systemic medications that need frequent dosing and may have noxious side effects. A novel system combining the temporal flexibility of systemic drug delivery and the spatial control of injectable biomaterials would improve the spatiotemporal control of medical therapies. Here we present an implantable biomaterial that harnesses in vivo click chemistry to enhance the delivery of suitable small molecules by an order of magnitude. The results demonstrate a simple and modular method to modify a biomaterial with small molecules in vitro and present an example of a polysaccharide modified hours after in vivo implantation. This approach provides the ability to precisely control the moment when biochemical and/or physical signals may appear in an implanted biomaterial. This is the first step towards the construction of a biomaterial that enhances the spatial location of systemic small molecules via in vivo chemical delivery.

"Glycoproteins and their mimics are challenging to produce because of their large number of polysaccharide side chains that form a densely grafted protein-polysaccharide brush architecture. Herein a new approach to protein bioconjugate synthesis is demonstrated that can approach the functionalization densities of natural glycoproteins through oligosaccharide grafting. Global amino acid substitution is used to replace the methionine residues in a methionine-enriched elastin-like polypeptide with homopropargylglycine (HPG); the substitution was found to replace 93% of the 41 methionines in the protein sequence as well as broaden and increase the thermoresponsive transition. A series of saccharides were conjugated to the recombinant protein backbones through copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition to determine reactivity trends, with 83-100% glycosylation of HPGs. Only an acetyl-protected sialyllactose moiety showed a lower level of 42% HPG glycosylation that is attributed to steric hindrance.

"<i>Giardia lamblia</i> is an important and ubiquitous cause of diarrheal disease. The primary agents in the treatment of giardiasis are nitroheterocyclic drugs, particularly the imidazoles metronidazole and tinidazole and the thiazole nitazoxanide. Although these drugs are generally effective, treatment failures occur in up to 20% of cases, and resistance has been demonstrated <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> Prior work had suggested that side chain modifications of the imidazole core can lead to new effective 5-nitroimidazole drugs that can combat nitro drug resistance, but the full potential of nitroheterocycles other than imidazole to yield effective new antigiardial agents has not been explored. Here, we generated derivatives of two clinically utilized nitroheterocycles, nitrothiazole and nitrofuran, as well as a third heterocycle, nitropyrrole, which is related to nitroimidazole but has not been systematically investigated as an antimicrobial drug scaffold. Click chemistry was employed to synthesize 442 novel nitroheterocyclic compounds with extensive side chain modifications. Screening of this library against representative <i>G. lamblia</i> strains showed a wide spectrum of <i>in vitro</i> activities, with many of the compounds exhibiting superior activity relative to reference drugs and several showing >100-fold increase in potency and the ability to overcome existing forms of metronidazole resistance. The majority of new compounds displayed no cytotoxicity against human cells, and several compounds were orally active against murine giardiasis <i>in vivo</i> These findings provide additional impetus for the systematic development of nitroheterocyclic compounds with nonimidazole cores as alternative and improved agents for the treatment of giardiasis and potentially other infectious agents.",28396548,"Click Chemistry-Facilitated Structural Diversification of Nitrothiazoles, Nitrofurans, and Nitropyrroles Enhances Antimicrobial Activity against Giardia lamblia.",1,1
"The copper(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition (CuAAC) reaction, a major click chemistry reaction, is widely employed in drug discovery and chemical biology. However, the success rate of the CuAAC reaction is not satisfactory as expected, and in order to improve its performance, we developed a recurrent neural network (RNN) model to predict its feasibility. First, we designed and synthesized a structurally diverse library of 700 compounds with the CuAAC reaction to obtain experimental data. Then, using reaction SMILES as input, we generated a bidirectional long-short-term memory with a self-attention mechanism (BiLSTM-SA) model. Our best prediction model has total accuracy of 80%. With the self-attention mechanism, adverse substructures responsible for negative reactions were recognized and derived as quantitative descriptors. Density functional theory investigations were conducted to provide evidence for the correlation between bromo-α-C hybrid types and the success rate of the reaction. Quantitative descriptors combined with RDKit descriptors were fed to three machine learning models, a support vector machine, random forest, and logistic regression, and resulted in improved performance. The BiLSTM-SA model for predicting the feasibility of the CuAAC reaction is superior to other conventional learning methods and advances heuristic chemical rules.",32013419,Predicting the Feasibility of Copper(I)-Catalyzed Alkyne-Azide Cycloaddition Reactions Using a Recurrent Neural Network with a Self-Attention Mechanism.,1,1
"Recent findings suggest that dopamine oxidation contributes to the development of Parkinson's disease (PD); however, the mechanistic details remain elusive. Here, we compare 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA), a product of dopamine oxidation that commonly induces dopaminergic neurodegeneration in laboratory animals, with a synthetic alkyne-functionalized 6-OHDA variant. This synthetic molecule provides insights into the reactivity of quinone and neuromelanin formation. Employing Huisgen cycloaddition chemistry (or ""click chemistry"") and fluorescence imaging, we found that reactive 6-OHDA p-quinones cause widespread protein modification in isolated proteins, lysates and cells. We identified cysteine thiols as the target site and investigated the impact of proteome modification by quinones on cell viability. Mass spectrometry following cycloaddition chemistry produced a large number of 6-OHDA modified targets including proteins involved in redox regulation. Functional in vitro assays demonstrated that 6-OHDA inactivates protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), which is a central player in protein folding and redox homeostasis.

"Employment of polymeric nanomaterials in cancer therapeutics is actively pursued since they often enable drug administration with increased efficacy along with reduced toxic side effects. In this study, drug conjugated micellar constructs are fabricated using triblock dendron-linear polymer conjugates where a hydrophilic linear polyethylene glycol (PEG) chain is flanked by well-defined hydrophobic biodegradable polyester dendrons bearing an antiangiogenic drug, combretastatin-A4 (CA4). Variation in dendron generation is utilized to obtain a library of micellar constructs with varying sizes and drug loadings. In particular, a family of drug appended dendron-polymer conjugates based on polyester dendrons of generations ranging from G1 to G3 and 10 kDa linear PEG were obtained using [3 + 2] Huisgen type ""click"" chemistry. The final constructs benefit from PEG's hydrophilicity and antibiofouling character, as well as biodegradable nature of the hydrophobic polyester dendrons. The hydrophobic-hydrophilic-hydrophobic character of these constructs leads to the formation of flower-like micelles in aqueous media. In addition to generation-dependent subnanomolar range critical micelle concentrations, the resulting micelles possess hydrodynamic diameters suitable for passive tumor targeting through enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect; thereby they are suitable candidates as controlled drug delivery agents. For all constructs, in vitro cytotoxicities were investigated and inhibitory effect of Comb-G3-PEG on tube formation was shown on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs).",27019335,Combretastatin A-4 Conjugated Antiangiogenic Micellar Drug Delivery Systems Using Dendron-Polymer Conjugates.,1,1
"Although platinum-based anticancer drugs prevail in cancer treatment, their clinical applications are limited by the severe side effects as well as their ineffectiveness against drug resistant cancers. A precise combination of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy can synergistically improve the therapeutic outcome and thereby may overcome drug resistance through a multipronged assault. Herein, we employ the well-defined cavity of a discrete organoplatinum(II) metallacage (M) to encapsulate octaethylporphine (OEP), a photosensitizer, forming a dual-functionalized system M⊃OEP that is wrapped into the hydrophobic core of the nanoparticles (MNPs) self-assembled from an amphiphilic diblock copolymer. Using a copper-free click reaction, a targeting ligand is conjugated on the surface of the MNPs, aiming to specifically deliver a chemotherapeutic drug and a photosensitizer to cancer cells. Benefiting from the enhanced permeability and retention effect and active targeting capability, high tumor accumulation of MNPs is achieved, leading to an improved therapeutic outcome and reduced side effects.

"The recently developed synthetic oligonucleotides referred to as ""click"" nucleic acids (CNAs) are promising due to their relatively simple synthesis based on thiol-X reactions with numerous potential applications in biotechnology, biodetection, gene silencing, and drug delivery. Here, the cytocompatibility and cellular uptake of rhodamine tagged, PEGylated CNA copolymers (PEG-CNA-RHO) were evaluated. NIH 3T3 fibroblast cells treated for 1 h with 1, 10, or 100 μg/mL PEG-CNA-RHO maintained an average cell viability of 86%, which was not significantly different from the untreated control. Cellular uptake of PEG-CNA-RHO was detected within 30 s, and the amount internalized increased over the course of 1 h. Moreover, these copolymers were internalized within cells to a higher degree than controls consisting of either rhodamine tagged PEG or the rhodamine alone. Uptake was not affected by temperature (i.e., 4 or 37 °C), suggesting a passive uptake mechanism. Subcellular colocalization analysis failed to indicate significant correlations between the internalized PEG-CNA-RHO and the organelles examined (mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, endosomes and lysosomes). These results indicate that CNA copolymers are cytocompatible and are readily internalized by cells, supporting the idea that CNAs are a promising alternative to DNA in antisense therapy applications.",29698604,"Cytocompatibility and Cellular Internalization of PEGylated ""Clickable"" Nucleic Acid Oligomers.",1,1
"A facile reversed-phase microemulsion method was used to synthesize shell-core nanospheres of SiO<sub>2</sub>@RCs (SiO<sub>2</sub>-encapsuled rare-earth metal complexes). β-d-Galactose was then grafted onto the surfaces of the nanospheres through the copper(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition click reaction for targeted delivery.

"Cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme is a promising anti-inflammatory drug target, and overexpression of this enzyme is also associated with several cancers and neurodegenerative diseases.

Herein, we describe the use of the cyclooxygenase-2 active site as a reaction vessel for the in situ generation of its own highly specific inhibitors. Multi-component competitive-binding studies confirmed that the cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme can judiciously select most appropriate chemical building blocks from a pool of chemicals to build its own highly potent inhibitor. Herein, with the use of kinetic target-guided synthesis, also termed as in situ click chemistry, we describe the discovery of two highly potent and selective cyclooxygenase-2 isozyme inhibitors. The in vivo anti-inflammatory activity of these two novel small molecules is significantly higher than that of widely used selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors.Traditional inflammation and pain relief drugs target both cyclooxygenase 1 and 2 (COX-1 and COX-2), causing severe side effects.

"PAK family kinases are RAC/CDC42-activated kinases that were first found in a soil amoeba 4 decades ago, and 2 decades later, were discovered in mammals as well. Since then at least 6 members of this family have been identified in mammals. One of them called PAK1 has been best studied so far, mainly because it is essential not only for malignant cell growth and metastasis, but also for many other diseases/disorders such as diabetes (type 2), AD (Alzheimer's disease), hypertension, and a variety of inflammatory or infectious diseases, which definitely shorten our lifespan. Moreover, PAK1-deficient mutant of C. elegans lives longer than the wild-type by 60%, clearly indicating that PAK1 is not only an oncogenic but also ageing kinase. Thus, in theory, both anti-oncogenic and longevity-promoting activities are among the ""intrinsic"" properties or criteria of ""clinically useful"" PAK1-blockers. There are a variety of PAK1-blocking natural products such as propolis and curcumin which indeed extend the healthy lifespan of small animals such as C. elegans by inducing the autophagy.

"Progress in genomics and proteomics attended to the door for better understanding the recent rapid expanding complex research field of metabolomics. This trend in biomedical research increasingly focuses to the development of patient-specific therapeutic approaches with higher efficiency and sustainability.

Finally the objective is to merge imaging and therapy at the same level. The design of molecules which fulfil these responsibilities is pivotal and requires proper chemical methodologies. In this context our modified solid phase peptide chemistry using temperature shifts during synthesis is considered as an appropriate technology. We generated highly variable conjugates which consist of molecules useful as diagnostically and therapeutically active molecules.

The efficiency of click reactions with fluorophore azides was studied using alkylated ctDNA by analysing the adenine adducts produced after thermal depurination. Click reactions ""on DNA"" were sensitive to steric effects (tether length to the alkyne) and, surprisingly, to the nature of the fluorophore azide. With the best combination of click partners and reagents, adducts could be detected in the nuclei of treated cells by microscopy or flow cytometry, provided that an appropriate detergent (Triton X-100 and not Tween 20) was used for permeabilisation.

"The use of polymers as biomaterials has provided significant advantages in therapeutic applications. In particular, the possibility to modify and functionalize polymer chains with compounds that are able to improve biocompatibility, mechanical properties, or cell viability allows the design of novel materials to meet new challenges in the biomedical field. With the polymer functionalization strategies, click chemistry is a powerful tool to improve cell-compatibility and drug delivery properties of polymeric devices. Similarly, the fundamental need of biomedicine to use sterile tools to avoid potential adverse-side effects, such as toxicity or contamination of the biological environment, gives rise to increasing interest in the microwave-assisted strategy. The combination of click chemistry and the microwave-assisted method is suitable to produce biocompatible hydrogels with desired functionalities and improved performances in biomedical applications. This work aims to synthesize RGD-functionalized hydrogels. RGD (arginylglycylaspartic acid) is a tripeptide that can mimic cell adhesion proteins and bind to cell-surface receptors, creating a hospitable microenvironment for cells within the 3D polymeric network of the hydrogels. RGD functionalization occurs through Huisgen 1,3-dipolar cycloaddition. Some PAA carboxyl groups are modified with an alkyne moiety, whereas RGD is functionalized with azido acid as the terminal residue of the peptide sequence. Finally, both products are used in a copper catalyzed click reaction to permanently link the peptide to PAA. This modified polymer is used with carbomer, agarose and polyethylene glycol (PEG) to synthesize a hydrogel matrix. The 3D structure is formed due to an esterification reaction involving carboxyl groups from PAA and carbomer and hydroxyl groups from agarose and PEG through microwave-assisted polycondensation. The efficiency of the gelation mechanism ensures a high degree of RGD functionalization. In addition, the procedure to load therapeutic compounds or biological tools within this functionalized network is very simple and reproducible.",27768038,The Synthesis of RGD-functionalized Hydrogels as a Tool for Therapeutic Applications.,1,1

"Acetaminophen (AP) is a popularly recommended over-the-counter analgesic-antipyretic in clinical use. However, the drug is handicapped by the occurrence of hepatotoxic insult following acute ingestion. Consequently, AP-induced hepatotoxicity is often implicated in accidental or suicidal overdose. In the current study, we investigated the potential of bioisosteric replacement of amide in AP with 1,2,3-triazoles in curbing AP-induced hepatotoxicity. The therapeutic utility of synthesized bioisosteres was established by careful tailoring and optimization of the synthetic methodology along with detailed toxicological testing of pharmacologically potent acetaminophen-triazole derivatives (APTDs). Along the same lines, we herein report a series of 17 novel APTDs synthesized via aromatic substitution using sodium azide, l-proline, and copper iodide followed by click reaction with substituted alkynes using copper sulfate and sodium ascorbate. Pharmacological evaluation of synthesized APTDs revealed that, out of the series of 17 compounds, <b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b> were found to be most efficacious in exerting anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic activity in an animal model. Further toxicity studies documented that, in both acute and sub-acute toxicology, AP administration caused significant hepatotoxicity, which was found to be a consequence of ROS-mediated oxidative stress. Potent APTDs (<b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b>), on the other hand, revealed no adverse event in both acute and sub-toxicological analyses. Median lethal dose (LD<sub>50</sub>) and no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) values for <b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b> were found to be >1000 mg/kg and 2000 mg/kg, respectively. The human equivalent dose, defining the maximum safe concentration of a compound in a human's physiology, was found to be 27.68 mg/kg for the most potent APTDs (<b>5a</b> and <b>5e</b>). Thus, it can be concluded that triazole incorporation into AP nucleus produced conjugates devoid of hepatotoxic manifestations, having the added advantage of anti-inflammatory efficacy along with analgesic and antipyretic potency.",31849220,"Bioisosteric Replacement of Amide Group with 1,2,3-Triazoles in Acetaminophen Addresses Reactive Oxygen Species-Mediated Hepatotoxic Insult in Wistar Albino Rats.",0,0
"Drug-induced hyperkalemia is a frequent and severe complication in the hospital setting. Other risk factors may also induce hyperkalemia but the combination of drugs and precipitating factors has not been extensively studied. The aim was to identify drug-induced hyperkalemia events in hospitalized older patients and to describe their combinations with precipitating factors. Two experts independently analyzed retrospective data of patients aged 75 years or more. Experts identified 471 hyperkalemia events and concluded that 379 (80.5%) were induced by drugs. The cause was multifactorial (i.e., at least one drug with a precipitating factor) in 300 (79.2%) of the 379 drug-induced hyperkalemia. Most of the drug-induced hyperkalemia events were avoidable (79.9%)-mainly because of the multifactorial cause (e.g., dosage adaptation during acute kidney injury). Drug-induced hyperkalemia events are frequently combined with precipitating factors in hospitalized older patients and their prevention should focus on these combinations.",30242829,"Hospital-Acquired Hyperkalemia Events in Older Patients Are Mostly Due to Avoidable, Multifactorial, Adverse Drug Reactions.",0,0
"A summary measure that reflects the global toxicity burden of a treatment is essential for comparing therapies.

"The process of discovering novel drugs to treat diseases requires a long time and high cost. It is important to understand side effects of drugs as well as their therapeutic effects, because these can seriously damage the patients due to unexpected actions of the derived candidate drugs. In order to overcome these limitations, computational methods for predicting the therapeutic effects and side effects have been proposed. In particular, text mining is a widely used technique in the field of systems biology, because it can discover hidden relationships between drugs, genes and diseases from a large amount of literature data. Compared with in vivo/in vitro experiments, text mining derives meaningful results with less time and cost. In this study, we propose an algorithm for predicting novel drug-phenotype associations and drug-side effect associations using topic modeling and natural language processing (NLP). We extract sentences in which drugs and genes co-occur from the abstracts of the literature and identify words that describe the relationship between them using NLP. Considering the characteristics of the identified words, we determine if the drug has an up-regulation effect or a down-regulation effect on the gene. Based on genes that affect drugs and their regulatory relationships, we group the frequently occurring genes and regulatory relationships into topics, and build a drug-topic probability matrix by calculating the score that the drug will have a topic using topic modeling. Using the matrix, a classifier is constructed for predicting the novel indications and side effects of drugs considering the characteristics of known drug-phenotype associations or drug-side effect associations. The proposed method predicts both indications and side effects with a single algorithm, and it can exclude drugs with serious side effects or side effects that patients do not want to experience from among the candidate drugs provided for the treatment of the phenotype. Furthermore, lists of novel candidate drugs for phenotypes and side effects can be continuously updated with our algorithm every time a document is added. More than a thousand documents are produced per day, and it is possible for our algorithm to efficiently derive candidate drugs because it requires less cost than the existing drug repositioning methods.

"Super-resolution microscopy allows imaging of cellular structures at nanometer resolution. This comes with a demand for small labels which can be attached directly to the structures of interest. In the context of protein labeling, one way to achieve this is by using genetic code expansion (GCE) and click chemistry. With GCE, small labeling handles in the form of noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) are site-specifically introduced into a target protein. In a subsequent step, these amino acids can be directly labeled with small organic dyes by click chemistry reactions. Click chemistry labeling can also be combined with other methods, such as DNA-PAINT in which a ""clickable"" oligonucleotide is first attached to the ncAA-bearing target protein and then labeled with complementary fluorescent oligonucleotides. This protocol will cover both aspects: I describe (1) how to encode ncAAs and perform intracellular click chemistry-based labeling with an improved GCE system for eukaryotic cells and (2) how to combine click chemistry-based labeling with DNA-PAINT super-resolution imaging. As an example, I show click-PAINT imaging of vimentin and low-abundance nuclear protein, nucleoporin 153.",29405005,Genetic Code Expansion- and Click Chemistry-Based Site-Specific Protein Labeling for Intracellular DNA-PAINT Imaging.,0,0
"Pleuromutilin is an antibiotic that binds to bacterial ribosomes and thereby inhibit protein synthesis. A new series of semisynthetic pleuromutilin derivatives were synthesized by a click chemistry strategy. Pleuromutilin was conjugated by different linkers to a nucleobase, nucleoside, or phenyl group, as a side-chain extension at the C22 position of pleuromutilin. The linkers were designed on the basis of the best linker from our first series of pleuromutilin derivatives following either conformational restriction or an isosteric methylene to oxygen exchange. The binding of the new compounds to the  Escherichia coli  ribosome was investigated by molecular modeling and chemical footprinting of nucleotide U2506, and it was found that all the derivatives bind to the specific site and most of them better than pleuromutilin itself. The effect of the side-chain extension was also explored by chemical footprinting of nucleotide U2585, and the results showed that all the compounds interact with this position to varying degrees. Derivatives with a conformational restriction of the linker generally had a higher affinity than derivatives with an isosteric exchange of one of the carbons in the linker with a hydrophilic oxygen. A growth inhibition assay with three different bacterial strains showed significant activity of several of the new compounds.",22280300,"A click chemistry approach to pleuromutilin derivatives, part 2: conjugates with acyclic nucleosides and their ribosomal binding and antibacterial activity.",0,0
"Immune checkpoint inhibitors are reshaping the prognosis of many cancer and are progressively becoming the standard of care in the treatment of many tumour types. Immunotherapy is bringing new hope to patients, but also a whole new spectrum of toxicities for healthcare practitioners to manage. Oncologists and specialists involved in the pluridisciplinary management of patients with cancer are increasingly confronted with the therapeutic challenge of treating patients with severe and refractory immune-related adverse events. In this Personal View, we summarise the therapeutic strategies that have been used to manage such toxicities resulting from immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment. On the basis of current knowledge about their pathogenesis, we discuss the use of new biological and non-biological immunosuppressive drugs to treat severe and steroid refractory immune-related adverse events. Depending on the immune infiltrate type that is predominant, we propose a treatment algorithm for personalised management that goes beyond typical corticosteroid use. We propose a so-called shut-off strategy that aims at inhibiting key inflammatory components involved in the pathophysiological processes of immune-related adverse events, and limits potential adverse effects of drug immunosuppression on tumour response. This approach develops on current guidelines and challenges the step-by-step increase approach to drug immunosuppression.",30614479,New therapeutic perspectives to manage refractory immune checkpoint-related toxicities.,0,0
"<b>Introduction</b>: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) are capable of differentiating into all types of cells in the body and so provide suitable toxicology screening systems even for hard-to-obtain human tissues. Since hPSCs can also be generated from differentiated cells and current gene editing technologies allow targeted genome modifications, hPSCs can be applied for drug toxicity screening both in normal and disease-specific models. Targeted hPSC differentiation is still a challenge but cardiac, neuronal or liver cells, and complex cellular models are already available for practical applications. <b>Areas covered</b>: The authors review new gene-editing and cell-biology technologies to generate sensitive toxicity screening systems based on hPSCs. Then the authors present the use of undifferentiated hPSCs for examining embryonic toxicity and discuss drug screening possibilities in hPSC-derived models. The authors focus on the application of human cardiomyocytes, hepatocytes, and neural cultures in toxicity testing, and discuss the recent possibilities for drug screening in a 'body-on-a-chip' model system. <b>Expert opinion</b>: hPSCs and their genetically engineered derivatives provide new possibilities to investigate drug toxicity in human tissues. The key issues in this regard are still the selection and generation of proper model systems, and the interpretation of the results in understanding <i>in vivo</i> drug effects.",30526128,Application of human pluripotent stem cells and pluripotent stem cell-derived cellular models for assessing drug toxicity.,0,0
"The misreplication of damaged DNA, a biological process termed translesion DNA synthesis (TLS), produces a large number of adverse effects on human health. This chapter describes the application of an artificial nucleoside/nucleotide system that functions as a biochemical probe to quantify TLS activity under in vitro and in vivo conditions. For in vitro studies, the artificial nucleotide, 3-ethynyl-5-nitroindolyl-2'-deoxyriboside triphosphate (3-Eth-5-NITP), is used as it is efficiently inserted opposite an abasic site, a highly pro-mutagenic DNA lesion produced by several types of DNA-damaging agents. The placement of the ethynyl moiety allows the incorporated nucleoside triphosphate to be selectively tagged with azide-containing fluorophores via ""click"" chemistry. This reaction provides a facile way to quantify the extent of nucleotide incorporation opposite this and other noninstructional DNA lesions. The corresponding nucleoside, 3-Eth-5-NIdR, can be used to monitor TLS activity in hematological and adherent cancer cells treated with compounds that produce noninstructional DNA lesions. As described above, visualizing the replication of these lesions is achieved using copper-catalyzed ""click"" chemistry to tag the ethynyl moiety present on the nucleotide with fluorogenic probes. This technique represents a new diagnostic approach to quantify TLS activity inside cells. In addition, the application of this ""clickable"" nucleoside provides a chemical probe to identify cells that become drug resistant by the facile replication of noninstructional DNA lesions produced by DNA-damaging agents.",31016706,Artificial Nucleosides as Diagnostic Probes to Measure Translesion DNA Synthesis.,0,0
"Background Adverse drug reactions remain to be an issue that compromise patient's safety in Jordan and worldwide. In Jordan, an assessment of factors involved in preventability of adverse drug reactions has not been conducted previously. Objectives To describe the proportion of preventable adverse drug reactions, and the causes of hospital-related preventable adverse reactions in one Jordanian hospital. Methods A prospective observational study of 4 months duration conducted by clinical pharmacists in the hospital. Setting Surgical and medical wards in one Jordanian private hospital. Main outcome measure Proportions of admissions related to adverse drug reactions, proportions of preventable reactions and analysis of the factors involved in the preventable adverse drug reactions. Results Out of 350 admissions recorded during the study period, a total of 38 (10.8%) adverse reactions were detected. Among those, 29 (8.3%) were detected in the hospital and 9 (2.6%) were the cause of the hospital admission. Many (44.7%) of the adverse drug reactions were preventable (31.6% were probably preventable and 13.1% were definitely preventable). About half (55.3%) were unpreventable. Insufficient monitoring was involved in 29.4% of the preventable adverse reactions and inappropriate dosing and drug-drug interactions were independently responsible for 17.6% of the preventable adverse reactions. Conclusion A high proportion of the identified adverse drug reactions were found to be preventable. Insufficient monitoring and inappropriate dosing were the most important factors associated with preventable adverse drug reactions. Nationally, more focused efforts need to be stimulated to prevent preventable adverse drug reactions in hospitals.",31654365,Preventability analysis of adverse drug reactions in a Jordanian hospital: a prospective observational study.,0,0

"Understanding interactions of glycans with proteins in key biological events has seen the development of various analytical methods such as microarray techniques. Label-free approaches, such as surface plasmon resonance (SPR) techniques are particularly attractive and we explore here the potential of a novel interface composed of lamellar Ti/Au/silicon dioxide derivatized with sugars to probe lectin-sugar interactions by SPR. Two parallel surface functionalization strategies have been developed: one in which azide-functionalized surfaces are linked via a Cu(I) ""click"" method to alkynyl-derivatized glycan partners and another wherein perfluorophenyl azide-functionalized surfaces are reacted through a C-H insertion photocoupling reaction with underivatized glycans.

"Drug response is often variable from one individual to another, which sometimes makes them difficult to use when the therapeutic range is narrow. This interindividual variability in response can be explained in part by genetic factors affecting the metabolism, transport and the mechanism of action of drugs. Pharmacogenetics studies the genetic mechanisms involved in the response to drugs in order to optimize drug therapy, both in terms of efficacy and job security. This article summarizes the most known present clinical applications that illustrate the benefit of pharmacogenetic tests available to the clinician and are feasible for routine therapeutic management of patients (prediction of efficacy and toxicity of drugs), but also to demonstrate the benefit of pharmacogenetic tests in terms of health economics (reducing the incidence of hospitalizations for adverse drug events).

"We evaluated the effects of pharmacist intervention for adverse drug reaction detection and exacerbation avoidance, as well as the severity and outcome of reactions based on analyses of pharmacist involvement in a collaborative approach to medicine. Of 5436 cases with pharmacist involvement, adverse drug reaction prevention was seen in 440, accounting for 8.1%, and exacerbation avoidance in 213, accounting for 3.9%. We concluded that pharmacist involvement contributes to detect adverse drug reactions and avoid exacerbation, and improves pharmacotherapy safety. We also analyzed 131 cases in which the course after intervention was followed. When categorized by adverse drug reaction severity, Grade 1 and 2 were the same at 45.8%, Grade 3 at 8.4%, respectively. Those findings suggested that pharmacist intervention contributes to early detection of an adverse drug reaction. Also, the relationship between clues for detecting adverse drug reactions by a pharmacist and their severity showed that objective evaluations such as clinical laboratory test results, physical assessments and medication history were important for detecting reactions that became more serious. Patients recovered or recovering from an adverse reaction comprised 76.4%, indicating that pharmacist intervention contributed to exacerbation avoidance and improvement. Our findings revealed the effects of pharmacist intervention for adverse drug reaction detection and exacerbation avoidance, and for safety improvement of pharmacotherapy. Additionally, we considered it necessary for the future pharmacist intervention to improve skills of assessing an adverse drug reaction objectively.",28566582,Evaluation of the Effects of Pharmacist Intervention for Adverse Drug Reaction Detection and Exacerbation Avoidance.,0,0
"As a typical bioorthogonal reaction, the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) has been used for drug design and synthesis. However, for localized drug synthesis, it is important to be able to determine where the CuAAC reaction occurs in living cells. In this study, we constructed a heterogeneous copper catalyst on a metal-organic framework that could preferentially accumulate in the mitochondria of living cells. Our system enabled the localized synthesis of drugs through a site-specific CuAAC reaction in mitochondria with good biocompatibility. Importantly, the subcellular catalytic process for localized drug synthesis avoided the problems of the delivery and distribution of toxic molecules. In vivo tumor therapy experiments indicated that the localized synthesis of resveratrol-derived drugs led to greater antitumor efficacy and minimized side effects usually associated with drug delivery and distribution.",30888728,A Biocompatible Heterogeneous MOF-Cu Catalyst for In Vivo Drug Synthesis in Targeted Subcellular Organelles.,0,0
"The O-linked-N-acetyl-d-glucosaminylation (O-GlcNAcylation) modulates numerous aspects of cellular processes. Akin to phosphorylation, O-GlcNAcylation is highly dynamic, reversible, and responds rapidly to extracellular demand. Despite the absolute necessity to determine post-translational sites to fully understand the role of O-GlcNAcylation, it remains a high challenge for the major reason that unmodified proteins are in excess comparing to the O-GlcNAcylated ones. Based on a click chemistry approach, O-GlcNAcylated proteins were labelled with azido-GalNAc and coupled to agarose beads. The proteome extracted from C2C12 myotubes was submitted to an intensive fractionation prior to azide-alkyne click chemistry. This combination of fractionation and click chemistry is a powerful methodology to map O-GlcNAc sites; indeed, 342 proteins were identified through the identification of 620 peptides containing one or more O-GlcNAc sites. We localized O-GlcNAc sites on proteins involved in signalling pathways or in protein modification, as well as structural proteins. Considering the recent role of O-GlcNAcylation in the modulation of sarcomere morphometry and interaction between key structural protein, we focused on proteins involved in the cytoarchitecture of skeletal muscle cells. In particular, several O-GlcNAc sites were located into protein-protein interaction domains, suggesting that O-GlcNAcylation could be strongly involved in the organization and reorganization of sarcomere and myofibrils.",30016717,O-GlcNAcylation site mapping by (azide-alkyne) click chemistry and mass spectrometry following intensive fractionation of skeletal muscle cells proteins.,0,0
"In bipolar disorder (BPD), long-term psychotropic drug treatment is often necessary to prevent relapse or recurrence. Nevertheless, adverse drug effects including disturbances in hepatic metabolism are observed and still poorly understood. Here, the association between hepatic gene expression and histopathological changes of the liver was investigated. By the use of microarrays (Affymetrix U133 plus2.0), a genome-wide expression study was performed on BPD patients with psychotropic drug treatment (n = 29) compared to unaffected controls (n = 20) and validated by quantitative real-time PCR. WebGestalt was used to identify over-represented functional pathways of the Reactome database. Association analyses between histopathological changes and differentially expressed genes comprised in the over-represented functional pathways were performed using regression analyses, from which feature-expression heatmaps were drawn. The majority of identified genes were underexpressed and involved in energy supply, metabolism of lipids and proteins, and the innate immune system. Positive associations were found for genes involved in all pathways and degenerative changes. The strongest negative association was observed between genes involved in energy supply and hepatic activity, as well as inflammation. In summary, we found a possible association between gene expression involved in various biological pathways and histopathological changes of the liver in BPD. Further, we found support for the probable primary toxic effect of psychotropic drugs on hepatic injury in BPD. Even if the safety of psychotropic drugs improves, adverse effects especially on hepatic function should not be underestimated.",31819046,Hepatic gene expression explains primary drug toxicity in bipolar disorder.,0,0
