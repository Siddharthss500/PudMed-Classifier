# PudMed-Classifier

The aim is to deploy a simple ML model (Bag-Of-Words Classifer Model) for Multi-Label Classification. Flask is used to build a simple REST API (to expose the API through web UI). Docker holds the ML model application. With this setup, one can invoke the ML model service using any REST client. Note that the application currently runs with 'LSTM' classifier model. This can be changed in the 'client.py' file.

## File structure

*data* - It has a small data file that is used for classification <br>
*models* - Trained (not fully) ML classifier models are present. They are Bag-Of-Words model, tf-idf model, LSTM and BERT <br>
*pkl_file* - It contains intermediate pickle files that are required for data pre-processing based on the model <br>
*client.py* - It pings the *server.py* file serially to receive classified output <br>
*server.py* - Flask application that accepts data to predict classes and returns a JSON format <br>
*Dockerfile* - It is used to build the docker image <br>
*requirements.txt* - It has a list of library packages needed for the docker image

## How to run locally

```
docker build -t classifier-model .
```
```
docker run -p 80:80 classifier-model
```

Note that before running the above two commands the repository must be cloned. Once inside the folder the following commands will pull up the docker image. 
```
python client.py
```
This command will ping the docker and receive the classified outputs continously.

## Future work

1. Productionalize the code
2. Update current models with better models
